Rob Gronkowski, NE TE  P [Breaking News and Video] 		LEE			
@Ari
	Sun 8:30		
Few players have put together a run of dominance like Gronkowski. He has finished as the No. 1 or No. 2 fantasy TE in four of the past five seasons and has posted a top-10 week at least 70 percent of the time in each of those years. For perspective, no other TE has managed to crack 69 percent even once in the past four years. Gronk lined up at wideout on 78 percent of his routes last season and ranked among the top two TEs in average depth of target, yards per reception and yards after the catch. He's easily fantasy's top TE and worth first-round consideration.

Jordan Reed, WAS TE [Breaking Video] 		CHUN			
Pit
	Mon 7:10		
Reed missed nearly half of his first two NFL seasons due to injury, leading to concerns that he would never emerge as a reliable offensive force. So much for that narrative. He broke out in 2015, finishing second among TEs in catches and TDs, fifth in receiving yards and sixth in targets. He missed two games, so durability remains somewhat of a concern. That said, he has locked himself into seven-plus targets per game as Kirk Cousins' favorite weapon and with it, top-end fantasy status.

Greg Olsen, Car TE  P [Breaking News and Video] 		BAE			
@Den
	Thu 8:30		
Olsen is as reliable a tight end as you'll find this side of Gronk. He has ranked among the top 10 at the position in targets, receptions, receiving yards and TDs in each of the past four seasons. Olsen is also more of a deep threat than most TEs--his average depth of target (10.5 yards) was the highest at the position last year. He scored seven TDs last season, but with WR Kelvin Benjamin back from a torn ACL, Olsen figures to lose some red zone opportunities. Still, the fact that he handles more than 20 percent of Cam Newton's targets will easily make him a strong TE1.

Coby Fleener, NO TE		HAN			
Oak
	Sun 1:00		
What can the Saints' offense do for a tight end? Well, last year Benjamin Watson caught 74 balls for 825 yards and six TDs--the best numbers of his 12-year career. Fleener is younger and bigger than Watson and will be featured right away, so the potential for a breakout season is clear. In Indianapolis, Fleener caught 183 passes for 2,154 yards and 17 TDs in four seasons, despite splitting time and targets with Dwayne Allen. Fleener will have Drew Brees' undivided attention in New Orleans, which makes the veteran a lock as a TE1 and gives him a high ceiling.
Fri, Jul 15
	127.5
Zach Ertz, Phi TE		FA			
Cle
	Sun 1:00		
Ertz simply needs to find the end zone a bit more to join the fantasy elite. Last year he was targeted seven times in the end zone (ninth among TEs) but caught only one of those balls. That speaks to luck more than anything else. Other than the fact that he has scored just nine TDs in three seasons, his production has been solid. Since entering the league in 2013, Ertz ranks 10th in targets, and now he'll get a boost from new coach Doug Pederson, who made good use of Travis Kelce in Kansas City. With the expected increase in his TD output, Ertz is likely to be under.valued in fantasy drafts.
Fri, Jul 15

Delanie Walker, Ten TE		HB			
Min
	Sun 1:00		
The Titans kept Walker busy last season. He finished 14th in the entire league in targets (133), easily the most of any tight end. He also led TEs in receptions (94) and finished third in receiving yards (1,088). The Titans should be better--and healthier--at WR this season, so that will mean fewer opportunities for Walker. But Marcus Mariota clearly loves his tight end, and if the second-year QB makes as much progress as expected, Walker will benefit.
Fri, Jul 15
	117.7
Travis Kelce, KC TE [Breaking News] 		BUNA			
SD
	Sun 1:00		
The Chiefs were popular targets of fantasy owners' frustration last season for supposedly not throwing to Kelce enough. In truth, he was plenty involved, with a 23 percent target share. He was on the field for 92 percent of the Chiefs' offensive plays and ranked among the top 11 TEs in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns for the second consecutive season. Kelce might not have the massive ceiling of some of the best players at his position, but he's a safe TE1 option in the middle rounds.
Fri, Jul 15
	114.4
Gary Barnidge, Cle TE  P [Recent News] 		RS			
@Phi
	Sun 1:00		
There are late bloomers, and then there's Barnidge. The 30-year-old had caught just 44 passes in his career entering last season. In 2015, he hauled in 79 for 1,043 yards and nine TDs. Only 22 players saw more targets than the 123 balls that went his way, including 17 in the end zone--fifth most in the league and five more than any other TE. Barnidge found all that success despite a whopping 24 percent of balls thrown his way that qualified as off target. Barnidge's performance, then, was no fluke, and even with the Browns' QB issues, he'll see enough volume to produce like a TE1 again.
Fri, Jul 15

Jason Witten, Dal TE [Recent News] 		SHEA			
NYG
	Sun 4:25		
Witten's fantasy ceiling has declined over the past few seasons, but even at 34, he remains a safe, consistent option. Witten has ranked among the top 10 TEs in both receptions and receiving yards in each of the past 12 seasons. He also hasn't missed a single game during that span. Last season he ranked 12th among TEs in fantasy points, and that was despite the extended absence of Tony Romo, which destroyed the entire Dallas offense. Still, given his age and lack of upside, it's best to view Witten as a TE2, but he is a reliable one.
Fri, Jul 15

Antonio Gates, SD TE [Breaking News] 		YU			
@KC
	Sun 1:00		
For fantasy purposes, Gates is a tight end, but he actually lined up at wide receiver on 91 percent of his passing routes last season. He's not as effective in that role as he used to be--Gates will be 36 this season and has seen his production dip over the past few years. Still, he continues to see heavy targets (7.5 per game last year), especially near the goal line. It's fair to worry about his durability, but the presence of Philip Rivers in San Diego's pass-heavy offense keeps Gates in the TE1 discussion.
Fri, Jul 15
	105.3
Jimmy Graham, Sea TE  Q [Breaking Video] 		FA			
Mia
	Sun 4:05		
Graham was dominant during his five-year tenure with the Saints, but he couldn't match that production in his first season in Seattle. He tore his patellar tendon in Week 12, but even before that, he wasn't a particu.larly good fantasy producer. He scored in two of his first three games but then went eight straight weeks without a TD. He did average 8.5 yards per target, seventh best among tight ends, and he remains a TE1 consideration in Seattle's high-scoring offense. But keep an eye on reports about Graham's knee, which could limit his effectiveness this season.
Fri, Jul 15
	102
Tyler Eifert*, Cin TE  O		MC			
@NYJ
	Sun 1:00		
Last season was finally Eifert's time in Cincinnati. After playing a situational role as a rookie and then missing all but one game in 2014, Eifert led all tight ends with 13 TDs in 2015. In fact, that was one shy of the league lead for all receivers. Those stats will also cause him to be drafted too high this year. Of those 13 scores, 10 came on 11 end zone targets. That's a 91 percent conversion rate, which isn't sustainable: the position-wide average is 45 percent. Eifert is still a quality TE1 option, but someone else will likely draft him earlier than anyone should.
Fri, Jul 15

Julius Thomas, JAC TE [Recent News] 		MC			
GB
	Sun 1:00		
Injuries have plagued thomas throughout his career, but he's been a strong fantasy asset when active. After a four-year stint in Denver, thomas signed with Jacksonville last year. His production was inconsis.tent, but after missing the first four weeks with a hand injury, thomas ranked 12th among TEs in fantasy points the rest of the way. He handled roughly seven targets per game in an improving offense, making him a solid TE1 option with upside. If healthy, he's a good bet to improve on his 2015 TD total of five, especially with Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns (24 combined scores) inevitably headed for regression.
Fri, Jul 15
	100.2
Martellus Bennett, NE TE		JSBS			
@Ari
	Sun 8:30		
Bennett has been fantasy's No. 7 scoring tight end over the past four years, but his stock took a significant hit when the Bears traded him to New England this offseason. While the Patriots score plenty of points, are short on WR talent and frequently use two-TE sets, Bennett simply won't enjoy the target volume he saw in Chicago and New York. After all, he'll play alongside a guy named Gronk. Bennett is fantasy's top TE hand.cuff and sure to be an asset near the goal line, but the position is deep enough that he should be viewed as a boom-or-bust TE2.
Fri, Jul 15
	95.4
Zach Miller, Chi TE  P [Recent News] 		AN			
@Hou
	Sun 1:00		
Miller was once an intriguing prospect in Jacksonville, but after failing to step up in three seasons with the Jaguars, he went another three years without seeing a single offensive snap. He resurfaced in Chicago last season and actually found his way onto the fantasy radar, moving into a significant role in Week 10 and thrice finishing among the top 10 TEs over the next seven weeks. With Martellus Bennett now in New England, Miller is locked in as Chicago's top receiv.ing TE. That puts him in position to put up numbers approaching TE1 status. But expectations should be tempered by the Bears' run-heavy approach.
Fri, Jul 15

Eric Ebron, Det TE  Q		SHEA			
@Ind
	Sun 4:25		
Ebron has yet to justify his selection as the 10th overall pick in the 2014 draft. Detroit hoped he could emerge as a star pass catcher, but he has struggled with injuries and limited opportunities in two seasons. When Ebron was active last year, he showed flashes of production, especially near the goal line. He posted eight top-13 fantasy weeks (seventh among TEs) and should see more targets this year now that Calvin Johnson has retired. Given that expected workload and Detroit's empha.sis on the passing game, Ebron is in position to take a third-year leap.
Fri, Jul 15
	89.8
Charles Clay, Buf TE  P		HB			
@Bal
	Sun 1:00		
Clay established himself as an important piece of the Bills' offense last season, even if that didn't lead to significant fantasy points. He handled 21 percent of the team's targets when healthy, but he produced only three top-10 weeks and three other top-20 fin.ishes. He also has durability issues--he missed three games last season--and plays in a run-first scheme. Still, he will likely be Tyrod Taylor's No. 2 target in an offense that ranked eighth in the NFL in offensive TDs last season, making him worth monitoring.
Fri, Jul 15
	87.1
Dwayne Allen, Ind TE [Recent News] 		FA			
Det
	Sun 4:25		
Allen has missed 21 of 64 regular-season games since entering the league in 2012, but that didn't stop the Colts from signing him to a four-year, $29.4 million extension during the offseason. The hope is that he can grow into an expanded role, with Coby Fleener having left for New Orleans. It won't take much to top last year's performance: the Colts rarely used him as a pass catcher--he managed just 16 receptions for 109 yards and a TD in 13 games. Allen is still just 26, though, and with the return of Andrew Luck, he could put up TE2 numbers.
Fri, Jul 15
	86
Clive Walford, Oak TE  P		FA			
@NO
	Sun 1:00		
Walford saw his role gradually increase as a rookie, to the point where he averaged five targets per game during Oakland's final five contests. He should carry that momentum into this season and fully supplant Mychal Rivera as the Raiders' top receiving TE. Oakland used him as a situational player for most of last season, but he still managed 28 catches for 329 yards and three TDs. He should become Derek Carr's third option this season--behind Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree--which makes him a borderline TE2 target with TE1 upside.
Fri, Jul 15
	84.6
Jordan Cameron, Mia TE [Breaking News] 		FA			
@Sea
	Sun 4:05		
The former Brown was limited by injuries during his first four seasons but finally made it through all 16 games last year. His stats didn't jump out in his first year in Miami, though, because the Dolphins (45 sacks allowed) had him run a route on only 62 percent of their pass plays. That decision limited him to just 68 targets (23rd among TEs), but new coach Adam Gase figures to rectify that. Gase's track record includes excellent work with Julius thomas, Martellus Bennett and Zach Miller during his time as an offen.sive coordinator, and that makes Cameron a bounce-back candidate who is worth a late-round look.

Ladarius Green*, Pit TE  O [Breaking News] 		FA			
@Wsh
	Mon 7:10		
Green is finally free from Antonio Gates' shadow in San Diego, and he lands in an offense that can exploit his considerable skills. His size (6-6, 240 pounds) and speed should immediately appeal to Ben Roethlisberger, and it wouldn't be crazy if his 2016 numbers approached his career stats (77 receptions, 1,087 yards, seven TDs). Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell will remain higher offensive priori.ties, but with Martavis Bryant suspended for a year and Heath Miller having retired, Green could push for eight-plus TDs in one of the NFL's top offenses. Consider Green a fringe TE1 with major upside.
Fri, Jul 15
	81.8
Benjamin Watson, Bal TE		HAN			
Buf
	Sun 1:00		
Seemingly by default, Watson turned out to be New Orleans' replacement for Jimmy Graham last season. The veteran started slowly but ended up among the top eight TEs in targets, receptions, receiving yards, touchdowns and fantasy points. His situation is dramatically different in Baltimore, where he is part of a deep TE group and will no longer benefit from Drew Brees. But Maxx Williams is inexperienced, Crockett Gillmore and Dennis Pitta have battled inju.ries and Nick Boyle is suspended, so Watson might be able to claim the primary role early. Even so, that leaves him as little more than a low-ceiling TE2.
Fri, Jul 15

Kyle Rudolph, Min TE [Recent News] 		MAN			
@Ten
	Sun 1:00		
Rudolph didn't generate much attention last season, but he quietly finished 14th among TEs in fantasy points. His success was based mostly on playing time: Rudolph appeared in all 16 games and was on the field for 85 percent of the Vikings' pass plays. Minnesota looked for him around the goal line, evidenced by his nine end zone targets, seventh most among TEs, but he turned only three of them into TDs. He'll maintain his position in the lineup, and at age 26 he is in his prime. But unless the Vikings shift away from their slow, run-based approach, he won't enter the TE1 mix.

Austin Seferian-Jenkins, TB TE [Breaking News] 		akc			
@Atl
	Sun 1:00		
If only Seferian-Jenkins could stay healthy. The massive tight end (6-5, 262 pounds) has been a force when active. But those occasions have been rare since Tampa Bay grabbed him in the second round of the 2014 draft. He played in only seven games last season but caught 21 of 39 targets for 338 yards and four TDs. He should enter 2016 as no worse than third in line for targets from Jameis Winston, and he might even move past 33-year-old Vincent Jackson in the pecking order. Still, he has played in just 16 games in two seasons; those durability concerns are all that separate him from consistent TE1 production.
Fri, Jul 15
	68.5
Jared Cook, GB TE [Recent News] 		FA			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
Cook is annually touted as a potential breakout fantasy star, largely because of his body: He stands 6-foot-5, 254 pounds and shows top-tier athletic ability. But he failed to deliver in both Tennessee and St. Louis, where he dropped far too many passes. Of course, neither team offered much at the QB position, and now he'll work with Aaron Rodgers. So if Cook is ever going to live up to his potential, now is the time. The Packers likely won't use him on every down, but Cook will have TE1 upside if he's on the field in passing situations. That certainly makes him worth a late-round pick.
Fri, Jul 15

Will Tye, NYG TE [Recent News] 		FA			
@Dal
	Sun 4:25		
His Baby Gates nickname might be a bit optimis.tic, but Tye was a pleasant surprise as a rookie. Undrafted in 2015, Tye filled in after Larry Donnell hurt his neck and caught 42 of 61 targets for 464 yards and three TDs. He flashed impressive athletic ability--hence the nickname--and showed potential as a pass-catching specialist, but Tye struggled with drops and was dreadful as a run blocker. Those issues could limit his playing time, especially with Donnell cleared to play. But if Tye can claim the starting job, he'll become an intriguing sleeper.

	Sun 1:00		
Amaro is coming off a shoulder injury that cost him all of 2015. The timing was terrible, as he could have thrived as Ryan Fitzpatrick's third option behind Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker. Instead, Jets TEs caught just eight passes. As a rookie in 2014, Amaro had 38 receptions for 345 yards and two TDs, and his size (6-5, 265 pounds) should allow offensive coordinator Chan Gailey to use him frequently in the slot. If he can nail down a significant role in the Jets' passing attack, the former second-round pick could become a sneaky breakout candidate.

Richard Rodgers, GB TE		YU			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
Rodgers surprisingly scored the ninth-most fantasy points among TEs last season. But as he enters his third season, it will be tough for him to match that production. Why? Well, WR Jordy Nelson missed the entire season and TE Andrew Quarless played in only five games, so Rodgers benefited from being in the right situation at the right time. Nelson returns this year, and the Packers have added Jared Cook, so it's likely that Rodgers--who isn't particularly fast or athletic--will step back into a smaller role in 2016.

Henry was the top TE in April's draft and landed with San Diego in the second round. His arms and hands measured poorly at the combine, he benched only 13 reps and he didn't participate in any ad.ditional drills. But the Chargers saw a quality receiver with outstanding hands (zero drops on 74 targets at Arkansas last season), excellent ball skills and enough speed to create separation from linebackers and safeties. His blocking is a work in progress, so he figures to run a lot of routes from the slot. Rookie TEs rarely make a fantasy impact anyway, and this one will spend 2016 behind Antonio Gates.

Williams looked like a breakout candidate this year until the Ravens added Benjamin Watson during the offseason. Granted, Watson is 35 and won't see nearly the targets that he got in New Orleans last year, but he will limit Williams' playing time. Williams was the first TE picked in the 2015 draft and played just over 40 percent of Baltimore's offensive snaps as a rookie. He caught 32 balls for 268 yards and a TD, and considering he is just 22, his future remains bright. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear he will play enough to recognize that potential in 2016.

Cam Newton, Car QB [Breaking Video] 		CHUN			
@Den
	Thu 8:30		
Newton took his game to a new level in 2015. He finished as fantasy's top scorer, tossing a career-high 35 TD passes and running for 10 scores. He has always picked up points on the ground, ranking among the top three QBs in carries, rushing yards and rushing TDs in each of his five seasons. But last year he added big chunks of yardage through the air: Newton's 10.5-yard average depth of throw--how far down the field the target is--trailed only Carson Palmer's for the league lead. Newton's accuracy remains an issue: He was off target on 21.2 percent of his throws, one of the league's worst marks, and completed just 59.8 percent of his attempts (league average: 63 percent). Still, he posted seven top-three fantasy weeks, and with Kelvin Benjamin back, Newton is primed for another elite campaign.
Fri, Jul 15

Aaron Rodgers, GB QB [Breaking News and Video] 		LEE			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
Rodgers took a surprising step backward last season. His 31-8 TD-INT ratio, while still excellent, was his worst mark in a full season since 2010. Known for his stunning accuracy, Rodgers completed 60.7 percent of his passes, his lowest rate since becoming a full-time starter in 2008, and was off target on a career-worst 20.5 percent of his throws. He averaged 6.7 yards per attempt and 11.0 yards per completion, which were--you guessed it--the lowest of his career. Despite those issues and the Packers' overall offensive struggles, Rodgers ranked seventh among QBs in fantasy points and posted a top-10 finish in half his starts (tied for sixth best). Of course, Rodgers had to operate without WR Jordy Nelson, who missed the season with a torn ACL. With Nelson back in the fold, Rodgers is a great bet to bounce back at age 32.

Russell Wilson, Sea QB [Recent News] 		BUNA			
Mia
	Sun 4:05		
The 2015 season was an odd experience for both Wilson and the Seattle offense. Through Week 10, Wilson had 10 TDs and seven interceptions and ranked just 17th among QBs in fantasy points. His best weekly finish was ninth. But over his final seven games, Wilson rang up 25 total TDs, threw one interception and trailed only Cam Newton in fantasy points. His worst weekly finish was seventh. Wilson's accuracy couldn't have been more impressive; he missed his intended target only 12.6 percent of the time, which was the league's best mark. He also adds value on the ground, ranking among the top three QBs in rushing yards in each of his four seasons. After ranking third in fantasy points among QBs two years in a row, Wilson is as safe as it gets.

Andrew Luck, Ind QB [Breaking News] 		RS			
Det
	Sun 4:25		
Last season was a lost campaign for Luck. Injuries limited him to just seven games, and even when he played he struggled. Luck threw for 15 TDs and 12 interceptions while completing just 55.3 percent of his passes--last among qualifying players. Luck was off target on 22.5 percent of his throws; only rookie Jameis Winston was worse among players who attempted at least 250 passes. On the plus side, Luck managed three top-10 fantasy weeks in his final four games, momentum that he should carry into this season now that he's back to full health. The 26-year-old remains one of the league's top young talents and operates in a pass-heavy offense. In other words, he's a great bet to rebound in a major way and projects as a solid QB1 with a high ceiling.
Fri, Jul 15

Drew Brees, NO QB		BAE			
Oak
	Sun 1:00		
Brees proved that reports of his impending demise were grossly exaggerated. After a slow start last season, the veteran quarterback went on to lead the NFL with 4,870 passing yards while tossing 32 TDs. Brees is still as efficient as they come: His 68.3 percent completion rate ranked second behind only that of Kirk Cousins. That wasn't simply the result of dinking and dunking, as Brees ranked sixth in yards per attempt (7.8). Brees has now finished among the top eight QBs in fantasy points 10 years in a row, though his ceiling wasn't quite as high last year, when he posted a top-10 week in only 40 percent of his starts (tied for 16th among QBs). His supporting cast should be better with TE Coby Fleener and second-round rookie WR Michael thomas, so Brees should produce another QB1 season.

Kirk Cousins, WAS QB		MC			
Pit
	Mon 7:10		
Jay Gruden's decision to roll with Cousins as his starter didn't exactly scream 'brilliant' early last season. Through six weeks, Cousins tossed six TDs and eight interceptions. But starting with a three-TD, 317-yard performance against the Bucs in Week 7, Cousins became a different player. He threw 23 TDs and just three picks over his final 10 games, and only three QBs scored more fantasy points during that span. Cousins plays a conservative, efficient style: Only 15.7 percent of his throws were off target, and he led the league with a 69.8 percent completion rate. Despite his strong finish, Cousins is still somewhat unproven--last year was the only season in which he appeared in more than six games. Still, with a healthy Jordan Reed and DeSean Jackson, he shouldn't have trouble providing solid QB2 numbers.

Ben Roethlisberger, Pit QB [Breaking News] 		akc			
@Wsh
	Mon 7:10		
The obvious issue with Roethlisberger is durability. He has played in all 16 games just three times in 12 seasons and missed four games last year. But when he was active in 2015, he was a fantasy stud. He topped NFL QBs by posting a top-10 week in two-thirds of his outings. Although he did throw too many interceptions (16), Big Ben completed 68 percent of his passes to rank fourth in the NFL and was third in ypa (8.4). That was a significant step up from 2014, when a full season under center and two monster performances obscured the fact that he posted just five top-10 weeks. The loss of WR Martavis Bryant will hurt, but with Antonio Brown, Ladarius Green and a healthy Le'Veon Bell around, Roethlisberger has enough weapons to deliver high-end QB1 production.

@Ind

Remember when Stafford was injury-prone? After sitting out 19 of his first 32 pro games, Stafford hasn't missed one in five years. During that span, he's been a steady fantasy contributor, finishing no better than fifth among QBs and no worse than 15th. He started slowly last year, but only four QBs scored more fantasy points after Week 5. Now he must show what he can do without the retired Calvin Johnson. Even with Megatron in the lineup last year, we might have seen a preview of the Lions' 2016 style. Stafford was more conservative, with an average depth of target of just 6.7 yards, but he completed a career-best 67.2 percent of his passes. Expect that trend to continue with Marvin Jones joining Golden Tate at WR and plenty of passes to TE Eric Ebron and RBs theo Riddick and Ameer Abdullah. Stafford is a solid QB2 option.

Eli Manning, NYG QB [Recent News] 		RS			
@Dal
	Sun 4:25		
Viewed one way, Manning is a testament to steadiness: He hasn't missed a game since his rookie year. Viewed another way, Manning is maddeningly inconsistent: He posted seven top-10 fantasy weeks last season but finished worse than 22nd among QBs five times. That makes it tough to rely on him as a clear QB1, especially considering he has put up only four top-10 fantasy seasons during his 12-year career. But two of those finishes came after Ben McAdoo took over the offense two years ago. Now McAdoo is the head coach, and he and Manning have a clear rhythm: Manning has ranked among the top seven QBs in attempts, completions and yards during McAdoo's time with the Giants, and only Tom Brady eclipsed Manning's 35 TD passes last season. Taking everything into account, Manning is a borderline QB1.

Tyrod Taylor, Buf QB [Breaking Video] 		BUNA			
@Bal

If you're looking for an underrated option to produce QB1 numbers, Taylor might be your guy. Because he missed a pair of games last season, his overall numbers don't appear impressive at first glance, but he ranked ninth among QBs in fantasy points per game (18.4) and posted a top-10 week in half his starts (tied for sixth at his position). Taylor thrives with the deep ball--he averaged 8.0 ypa (fifth among QBs) and produced the league's third-highest average depth of throw (10.5 yards). But Taylor really separates himself on the ground; he trailed only Cam Newton in rushing yards among QBs. After spending four years as Joe Flacco's backup in Baltimore, the 27-year-old is locked in as Buffalo's starter. Considering the Bills tied for eighth in offensive TDs last season, that's a good place to be.

@KC

Rivers is coming off his seventh top-12 fantasy season in the past eight years, a feat that's all the more impressive when you consider how injuries decimated the Chargers on both sides of the ball. In fact, during the season's first nine weeks, Rivers posted five top-seven fantasy performances, and only Tom Brady had more points among QBs. Eventually, injuries to the likes of Keenan Allen, Melvin Gordon and Ladarius Green took too much of a toll, but Rivers still led the NFL in attempts and completions and trailed only Drew Brees in passing yards (4,792). Rivers' accuracy remains as sharp as ever, and it shouldn't take much luck for his supporting cast to be healthier in 2016. Combined, those factors make him a terrific--and underrated--target in the later rounds.

Andy Dalton, Cin QB [Recent News] 		YU

Only a broken thumb in Week 14 kept Dalton from posting a top-five fantasy season among QBs. He produced a top-10 week in 58 percent of his complete games, which was the fourth-best mark among QBs and actually better than Cam Newton's. That level of play represented a serious step up from Dalton's first four seasons, when he hovered around the fringe of QB1 territory. Dalton increased both his accuracy (career-best 66.1 percent completion rate) and big-play ability (career-high 8.4 ypa) last year. Marvin Jones and Mohamed Sanu are gone, but A.J. Green is still wearing orange and black, and TE Tyler Eifert and RB Giovani Bernard remain major threats as well. If you prioritize other positions early in your draft, you could do worse than ending up with Dalton.

Carson Palmer, Ari QB		HB			
NE

Palmer experienced his best fantasy finish (fifth) since 2006, making him one of last season's top comeback stories. Leaning heavily on Arizona's talented wide receiver unit, Palmer posted a league-high 10.9-yard average depth of target. Not surprisingly, Palmer also topped all QBs with 8.7 yards per attempt and 13.7 yards per completion. Palmer does enter 2016 with a pair of concerns, though. First, his ceiling isn't as high as that of other top QBs: He managed a top-10 fantasy week in only 44 percent of his appearances, tied for 10th at the position. Second, Palmer is now 36, which makes him a candidate for statistical regression. Even with a small drop-off, Palmer should maintain his QB1 status.

Alex Smith, KC QB [Recent News] 		HB

Simply put, there's little reason to look Smith's way on draft day. He's as conservative a QB as you'll find in the NFL: His 6.6-yard average depth of throw was the lowest in the league last year. That actually represented a step up from 2014, when his average pass traveled just 5.8 yards past the line of scrimmage. Smith offsets his lack of arm strength with efficiency--he completed 65.3 percent of his passes last year. And he does pick up a few extra points with his scrambling ability, having placed among the top eight QBs in rushing yards three years in a row. Still, Smith has posted only five top-10 weeks over the past two seasons. With such limited upside, you're better off turning elsewhere for a QB2.

Jameis Winston, TB QB		SHEA

Winston finished as fantasy's No. 13 QB last season, a strong showing for a rookie. But it's misleading: He posted a top-10 fantasy week in just 19 percent of his starts, which ranked 28th at the position. Still, he was consistently decent: Winston placed better than eighth among QBs only once but never fell below 23rd. That made him a fine option as a QB2. To climb into the next tier, Winston must become more accurate. He was off target on 23 percent of his throws, the league's worst mark among passers with at least 250 attempts. Plus, he completed only 58.3 percent of his passes. With a run-first offense and an underwhelming supporting cast, it's tough to foresee Winston busting out this season.

Ryan Fitzpatrick, NYJ QB		HAN

Considering that he was the QB for 94 percent of the pass plays during Chan Gailey's three-year run as Buffalo's head coach, Fitzpatrick was a seamless fit for Gailey's offense with the Jets. Still, the Jets couldn't have expected anything close to what Fitzpatrick delivered last season: He posted career highs in passing yards (3,905) and TDs (31), which helped him to an 11th-place finish in fantasy points (also a career best). Fitzpatrick also rushed for 270 yards and two scores. Even in his best season, though, there were red flags. He completed only 59.6 percent of his passes, and he averaged just 6.9 ypa, 27th out of the 38 QBs who threw at least 150 passes. Fitzpatrick remains unsigned, but regardless of where he lands--the Jets still seem likely--he is almost a sure bet for statistical regression.

Romo was limited to just four appearances and 216 snaps last season after breaking his collarbone in Week 2 and then reinjuring it in Week 12. Injuries are nothing new for the veteran QB: He has missed at least one game three years running and has been sidelined for at least 10 contests in two of the past six seasons. Romo's impact on the Cowboys is massive: they averaged 3.3 offensive touchdowns per game in 2014, compared with just 1.5 last year, which was second worst in the NFL. Even though Romo is 36 and has durability concerns, he has been a lock for mid- to lower-end QB1 production when active. If you prefer to wait on drafting a QB, Romo is a strong late-round target.

Blake Bortles, JAC QB		JSBS			
GB

Believe it or not, Bortles had the fourth-most QB fantasy points last season. But before you slot him in as an automatic QB1 for 2016, consider some key factors. Bortles was tied for second in the NFL with 35 TDs, but he also led the league with 18 interceptions. Jacksonville called pass plays 68 percent of the time (second in the NFL) and scored 88 percent of its offensive TDs through the air, so it's likely his TD passes will regress. His completion percentage declined ever so slightly from his rookie year, but that probably was just the result of throwing deep more often. Still, Bortles has a strong cadre of receiving options and also picks up points with his legs. Even if he remains inefficient in some areas, Bortles should flirt with QB1 numbers in his third season.

Derek Carr, Oak QB		AN

Halfway through last season, Carr seemed to be enjoying a second-year breakout, posting six top-10 fantasy weeks in his first nine games. But he did not sustain that success and faded badly. Over the final seven weeks, he averaged an 18th-place weekly positional ranking and cracked the top 10 just once. His rate stats weren't much better than those in his rookie season--his average depth of throw remained at 7.9 yards, and he posted a higher interception percentage and missed his target more often. But he threw 11 more TDs than in 2014, due largely to an improved supporting cast. Carr's receivers generated 5.3 yards after the catch in 2015 after managing only 4.3 the year before. Amari Cooper, Michael Crabtree and Clive Walford are all back with an added year of experience, so Carr should have enough weapons to sustain QB2 production.

After showing steady signs of improvement in his first three seasons, Tannehill seemed to hit a wall in 2015. His completion percentage dropped from 66.4 to 61.9, which would seem to indicate he was less accurate. Look closer, though, and you'll realize his dip in precision was due to throwing downfield more often. That added emphasis on the deep ball helped Tannehill set a career high in passing yards (4,208), but he finished just 17th among QBs in fantasy points after ranking eighth in 2014. That change in style, plus the hiring of coach Adam Gase--who is known for his work with QBs--makes Tannehill tough to project going forward. But when you consider his improving receiver corps (Jarvis Landry, DeVante Parker, Leonte Carroo, Kenny Stills), Tannehill looks like a potential bounce-back candidate.

A 25-year-old pocket passer with a 6-foot-8, 240-pound frame, Osweiler carries intrigue with him to Houston but not much of a track record. Denver drafted Osweiler in the second round in 2012, and he threw just 30 passes as Peyton Manning's backup over his first three seasons. Last year he appeared in eight games--including six full ones--and threw for 1,967 yards and 10 TDs. He produced a pair of top-10 weeks and ranked 12th overall among QBs during his span as a starter, but he was benched for ineffectiveness in Week 17, and you know what Manning and the Broncos did after that. Now Osweiler is the clear starter in Houston after signing a massive free agent contract. Although unproven, he is set up for success with a strong supporting cast that includes DeAndre Hopkins, Lamar Miller and Will Fuller.

Joe Flacco, Bal QB  P [Breaking News] 		FA

Flacco is a solid NFL QB, but his play has yet to translate into high-end statistical production. His best fantasy season came all the way back in 2010, and even then he ranked only 10th among QBs. Flacco has never placed higher than 11th in passing yards or 10th in passing TDs, and last season was more of the same before he suffered a season-ending torn ACL and MCL in Week 11. He was a top-10 fantasy QB in just 40 percent of his outings (tied for 16th in the NFL), and his 10.5 yards per completion was second worst in the league. If you're looking for reasons for optimism, Flacco's targets should be better--and healthier--with Benjamin Watson and Mike Wallace joining Steve Smith, Breshad Perriman and Maxx Williams. More likely, though, Flacco is headed for another low-ceiling QB2 campaign.

After finishing four of the previous five seasons as a top-eight fantasy QB, Ryan fell to 19th last season, tied for the worst rank of his career. He posted a top-10 fantasy week in just 19 percent of his starts, which was worse than 27 other QBs. Ryan really isn't to blame, though. His efficiency stats were nearly identical to those in 2014, but he dealt with nine more dropped passes and less post-catch production from his receivers. Ryan's accuracy remained superb. It helped that he averaged only 7.8 air yards per attempt, but Ryan also completed 66.3 percent of his throws and was off target only 12.9 percent of the time. He trailed only Russell Wilson in the latter category. The bottom line, though, is that until Atlanta upgrades the talent around him, a major turnaround won't happen.

When he played, though, Mariota performed well. He finished as a top-10 fantasy QB in 45 percent of the games in which he played at least half the snaps, good for 10th at the position. He showed that he wasn't afraid to challenge defenses down the field, posting a 9.2-yard average depth of target. That approach helped him tie for ninth in the NFL with 7.6 ypa. With an improved supporting cast that includes DeMarco Murray, Derrick Henry, Delanie Walker, Dorial Green-Beckham, Kendall Wright and Rishard Matthews, Mariota is a solid candidate for a second-year leap--provided he can stay healthy.

Despite dealing with an underwhelming and injury-plagued supporting cast, Brady produced yet another strong fantasy season. He put up a top-10 score at his position in 10 weeks, which was tied for most among QBs, although eight of those performances came during his first nine outings. Despite playing in an offense that emphasizes short, conservative passes, he still threw for 36 TDs. As usual, Brady was unmatched in terms of ball security, tossing only seven interceptions in 624 attempts. With the addition of TE Martellus Bennett and improved depth at wide receiver, it's possible Brady's efficiency will be even better in 2016. The four-game suspension stings, but Brady will be so good upon his return that he is well worth stashing on your bench.

Cutler was generally useless for fantasy owners last year, producing just one week ranked among the top 10 QBs. Dig deeper, though, and you'll discover that it wasn't all Cutler's fault. He completed 64.4 percent of his passes (14th), averaged 7.6 ypa (11th) and was off target on just 15.7 percent of his throws (tied for sixth). Instead, Cutler was undone by constant injuries to his supporting cast, and it's worth remembering that he was tied for seventh among QBs in top-10 weeks in 2014. The Bears' run-heavy approach limits Cutler's ceiling, but with the presence of wide receivers Alshon Jeffery and Kevin White--who missed his entire rookie season after Chicago took him in the first round--Cutler is worth monitoring as a bounce-back candidate.

Teddy Bridgewater, Min QB [Recent News] 		akc

During his first two seasons, Bridgewater showed impressive efficiency, but Minnesota's run-heavy, low-scoring offense didn't allow him to spread his wings. He completed 65.3 percent of his passes and averaged 7.2 ypa in 2015, and he has finished in the upper half of the NFL in both categories in each of his two seasons. Part of the reason he is so accurate is that he doesn't look downfield often: Bridgewater's 7.1-yard average depth of throw was fifth lowest among QBs with at least 90 attempts last year and helps explain why he posted just two top-10 fantasy weeks. Having shown flashes in small samples, Bridgewater remains an intriguing prospect, and the addition of first-round WR Laquon Treadwell helps, but it's hard to put much faith in the QB as a legit fantasy prospect until Minnesota opens up its offense.

After a tumultuous four seasons in Washington, Griffin heads to Cleveland, where he will compete for the starting job. The second overall pick in 2012, Griffin was a fantasy superstar right out of the gate, posting a top-10 fantasy week in two-thirds of his 15 rookie starts. The wheels fell off from there, as he struggled in 2013, appeared in only nine games in 2014 and sat out the entire 2015 season. His 7.0-yard average depth of throw would have been third lowest in the league in 2014 if he had attempted enough passes to qualify, and he has rushed for only one TD since his rookie season. RG3 is only 26, and a resurgence in Hue Jackson's offense isn't out of the question. But that doesn't mean you should use anything other than a late-round pick to get him.

Bradford did what was asked in his lone season in Chip Kelly's offense, taking exactly what the defense allowed and not much more. His 7.1-yard average depth of throw was fourth lowest in the NFL, but he was efficient on all those short passes, missing his target just 14.5 percent of the time (third best among QBs with at least 120 passes). That approach didn't generate much fantasy success: He produced just three top-10 weeks, two of which were ninth-place finishes in Weeks 16 and 17. Bradford also remains a perpetual injury risk--he has missed 33 games during his six seasons, including two last year. New coach Doug Pederson figures to rely on the pass, but Bradford's conservative play and durability issues--not to mention the inevitable promotion of Carson Wentz--leave him without much fantasy appeal.

The first overall pick in April's draft, Goff is the heavy favorite to line up under center when the Rams open the season. At 6-4, 215 pounds, Goff is a pocket passer with good size and a great arm. He was also one of the youngest QBs in the draft--Goff won't turn 22 until October. His accuracy is solid but could be better, and he handles pressure very well. Goff shows good touch, and his cannon arm produces accurate deep balls. During his final two seasons at Cal, he tossed 78 touchdowns and 20 interceptions. He won't add anything with his legs, which is notable as we determine his fantasy value. Expect Goff to spend a hefty chunk of his rookie season handing the ball to Todd Gurley, which leaves him with little fantasy appeal.

Gabbert hasn't come close to living up to expectations since the Jaguars selected him with the 10th overall pick in the 2011 draft. After struggling throughout the first four seasons of his career, Gabbert was better--albeit still below average--in relief of Colin Kaepernick last year, his second with the 49ers. Playing a conservative game, Gabbert posted a 7.0-yard average depth of target and was right near the league average in completion percentage (63 percent) and yards per attempt (7.2). Although it's possible Gabbert will take another step forward, it is more likely that he again will back up Kaepernick. Even if Gabbert wins the job, his supporting cast isn't very good and the 49ers face a tough schedule. Needless to say, avoid him on draft day.

The Broncos moved up to the 26th pick to draft Lynch, who enjoyed a highly productive tenure at Memphis. The rookie is massive at 6-foot-7, 244 pounds, and he is extremely mobile for his size, which has earned him comparisons to Joe Flacco. He has good arm strength and is fairly accurate with his throws. His 0.9 percent interception rate was the best among QB prospects in April's draft, but Lynch played a conservative game at Memphis: His average depth of throw was just 7.6 yards. Lynch may not open the season as Denver's starter, but with only Mark Sanchez ahead of him on the depth chart, it seems likely that he will end up making several starts for the defending champs.

After spending the first seven years of his career with the Jets and Eagles, Sanchez heads to Denver, where he will compete with Paxton Lynch to replace Peyton Manning. Even if he wins the starting job for the Super Bowl champs, there isn't much to like. Only once has Sanchez finished a season ranked better than 18th among QBs in fantasy points. Last year he attempted 91 passes in place of Sam Bradford, yet despite a conservative approach that led to a 5.8-yard average depth of throw (lowest among those with at least 40 attempts), Sanchez still managed to throw four interceptions. In other words, he's not an effective passer. Couple that with Gary Kubiak's emphasis on the run game and there's no reason to draft Sanchez.

Remember everything we thought about the Patriots' QB situation at this time last year? Well, we're back there again. It appeared we'd finally get a look at Garoppolo last season, with Tom Brady facing a four-game suspension to begin the year. Instead, the Deflategate punishment was overturned and Garoppolo was limited to four passing attempts. But with Brady's suspension reinstated, Garoppolo will get his chance in 2016; he is the heavy favorite to start the first four games over rookie Jacoby Brissett. Garoppolo has completed 20 of 31 passes for 188 yards and a TD in his two-year career but should be able to provide QB2 numbers in place of Brady. Games against Arizona, Miami, Houston and Buffalo limit his upside, though, and even Brady's owners should look elsewhere for an early-season starter.

Colin Kaepernick, SF QB  P [Breaking News] 		FA

Kaepernick has seen his production drop off considerably since he finished 2013 as fantasy's No. 9 QB, to the point where he was benched last season. Accuracy has been a huge problem over the past two seasons. He was off target on 22.3 percent of his throws in 2014 (third worst in the league) and 26.4 percent last year (worst). But his ability to scramble remains enticing: Despite sitting out half the season, Kaepernick finished among the top eight QBs in rushing yards for the fourth straight year. Now the question is what effect Chip Kelly will have on him. He is the favorite to open as the 49ers' starter, and Kelly's high-volume offense should at least offer plenty of opportunities to score fantasy points. That makes Kaepernick worth a draft flier, but be aware that his inefficiency could lead to another demotion.

Wentz is the Eagles' new franchise quarterback after Philadelphia traded up to take him second in April's draft. His tenure as the starter won't begin right away, though, with Sam Bradford and Chase Daniel ahead of him. Wentz is big (6-5, 237 pounds) and athletic, with a solid arm that is accurate. He threw the ball well at the combine and came in above average in nearly every drill, especially the three-cone, short shuttle and broad jump. Wentz's mobility should eventually boost his fantasy stock considerably: Similar to Blake Bortles or Alex Smith, Wentz figures to add a few hundred rushing yards each year. He is certainly worth stashing in dynasty leagues given his potential, but just don't expect many starts in 2016.

Most of McCown's success has come late in his career. The quarterback has attempted at least 200 passes in each of the past three years after eclipsing that mark just twice in his first 10 seasons. Oddly enough, his recent run of productivity has come with three different teams, though the only time McCown was relevant in fantasy came during a late-season surge with the 2013 Bears. Otherwise he has been mediocre at best, particularly when it comes to accuracy: He was off target on 20.1 percent of his throws in 2014 and 20.6 percent in 2015, both of which ranked in the NFL's bottom 10. McCown will compete with Robert Griffin III for the starting job in Cleveland, but even if he wins that battle, he'll be well off the fantasy radar.

A locker room altercation last summer left Smith, the early favorite to start for the Jets, with a broken jaw and opened the door for Ryan Fitzpatrick to run away with the job. Smith appeared in only one game, tossing two TDs and an interception in a loss to Oakland. That performance brought his career totals to 27 and 35, respectively, which explains why the Jets were so happy to stick with Fitzpatrick. Smith has struggled with accuracy throughout his career, but even with such glaring weaknesses, he could flirt with fantasy relevance if asked to start in Chan Gailey's spread offense. After all, he has WRs Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker on his side, and he can add points with his legs--Smith finished among the top seven QBs in carries in both 2013 and 2014.

The 2015 season was an odd one for Hoyer. After rotating with Ryan Mallett early in the year, Hoyer settled in as the Texans' starter and engineered four consecutive top-11 fantasy performances from Weeks 4 through 7. Then reality struck in the form of injuries and ineffectiveness. He missed three games over the final nine weeks and averaged a 22nd-place finish when active. His tenure as the team's starter ended when Hoyer completed 15 of 34 passes for 136 yards, no TDs and four interceptions against Kansas City in the playoffs. In April, the Texans released him, and he signed with the Bears to back up Jay Cutler. His new surroundings won't change the fact that Hoyer was the league's second-least accurate passer (23.7 percent off-target rate) in 2014 and only slightly better last year (20.6).

Case Keenum, LA QB [Recent News] 		FA			
@SF
	Mon 10:20		
Keenum looked like he would be the starter until the Rams traded for the top pick in April's draft, which they used to select Jared Goff. Fantasy owners were fine with that scenario: Keenum might have been the league's worst starting QB. In five starts last season, his best weekly finish among QBs was 17th, and he has completed only 57 percent of his career passes while averaging 6.6 ypa. Even if Keenum manages to beat out Goff to start the season, he will simply play game manager for an offense that revolves around RB Todd Gurley. He hasn't shown that he is capable of doing much more than that. Additionally, the Rams are a strong bet to finish last in the league in pass attempts, and there is basically no chance of Keenum starting all 16 games.

Todd Gurley, LA RB [Breaking Video] 		AN			
@SF
	Mon 10:20		
Although the Rams took Gurley with the 10th pick in the 2015 draft, there were legitimate concerns that he wouldn't produce much as a rookie because of the torn ACL he suffered at Georgia. But Gurley was active by Week 3 and played a significant role in Week 4. From that point on, only Devonta Freeman scored more fantasy points among running backs. Gurley has already proved that he can be an early-down workhorse, and he has 10-plus-TD upside in the Rams' run-heavy attack. One concern: Rams QBs targeted Gurley only 27 times in 13 games; that lack of impact in the passing game limits his upside.

David Johnson, Ari RB [Breaking News and Video] 		akc			
NE
	Sun 8:30		
A 2015 third-round pick, Johnson began his career pushing Chris Johnson and Andre Ellington for snaps before taking a star turn in the fantasy playoffs. In Weeks 13 through 17, Johnson racked up 658 yards and five TDs on 107 touches, which easily made him fantasy's top-scoring RB during that stretch. He averaged a healthy 4.6 ypc, including 2.3 after contact (fifth best among RBs). He also has great value in PPR leagues--Johnson caught 15 passes in Arizona's two playoff games. Now the clear lead back in Arizona's high-scoring attack, he carries the high floor and high ceiling you want in a first-round pick.

Adrian Peterson, Min RB  P [Breaking Video] 		CHUN			
@Ten
	Sun 1:00		
Considering that he missed nearly all of 2014, Peterson was polarizing in fantasy drafts last year. Would he be fresh or rusty after the year off? It turned out to be the former: Last season Peterson led the NFL in carries and rushing yards and tied for first in rushing TDs. He posted a league-high 12 top-20 weeks at RB, which included seven top-10 finishes. The one thing that continues to hold Peterson back is his lack of usage as a pass catcher: He had just 30 receptions for 222 yards in 2015. At 31, Peterson's days as a fantasy superstar are dwindling, but he's still the workhorse in Minnesota's run-first scheme.
Fri, Jul 15
	223.3
Ezekiel Elliott, Dal RB  P [Breaking News and Video] 		FA			
NYG
	Sun 4:25		
The fourth pick in April's draft, Elliott should step in immediately as the Cowboys' lead back. He is a terrific rusher, a solid pass catcher and a close-to-elite pass blocker. At 6 feet, 225 pounds, Elliott has plenty of size and runs with enough power that he's assured heavy work near the goal line. There aren't many pro backs who push for 20 touches every week, but Elliott figures to join that list, and he'll do it behind the Cowboys' outstanding offensive line. At just 21, Elliott has major fantasy upside, making him well worth consideration in the middle of the first round.
Fri, Jul 15

LeSean McCoy, Buf RB  P [Recent News] 		CHUN			
@Bal
	Sun 1:00		
Despite missing a quarter of the 2015 season, McCoy finished 17th among RBs in fantasy points during his first year in Buffalo. McCoy's consistency was impressive: He ranked no worse than 26th in a given week before hurting his knee in Week 15. It helped that the Bills' offense was better than expected, averaging 2.6 offensive TDs per game, eighth in the league. McCoy, who will be 28 as the season starts, will need to fend off impressive second-year back Karlos Williams, but the veteran is in a great position as the starter in Buffalo's run-heavy, high-scoring offense. He's a strong RB2 with upside.

Jamaal Charles, KC RB  P [Breaking News] 		HB			
SD
	Sun 1:00		
Charles was well on his way to another huge season when he tore his ACL in Week 5. Before the injury, he had accrued 541 yards and five TDs in less than five games; only Devonta Freeman scored more fantasy points among running backs during that span. Charles has finished as a top-11 fantasy back in five of the past seven seasons, with the only exceptions being injury-shortened campaigns in 2011 and 2015. Yes, Charles is 29 and coming off his second ACL injury, but he showed no signs of slowing down last season and should be ready for Week 1. He is a borderline RB1.
Fri, Jul 15
	210.5
Devonta Freeman, Atl RB [Breaking Video] 		LEE			
TB
	Sun 1:00		
Freeman might have been 2015's biggest surprise. He burst onto the scene during the first month and went on to lead all RBs in fantasy points. Although he did a significant chunk of his damage in Weeks 3 through 6, Freeman finished strong with three top-11 performances in Weeks 15 through 17. An every-down player, Freeman averaged a hefty 18.7 carries and 6.9 targets in 14 full games. His efficiency (4.0 ypc, 1.6 yac, 7.9 ypr, a position-high seven drops) wasn't quite as impressive, which figures to lead to an expanded role for Tevin Coleman. Still, Freeman will be busy enough as a rusher and receiver to remain in the RB1 mix.
Fri, Jul 15
	204.3
Lamar Miller, Hou RB [Recent News] 		RS			
Chi
	Sun 1:00		
After being underused in four seasons with the Dolphins, Miller should get all the work he can handle in Houston. He averaged just 196 carries during his final three years in Miami and saw just 12.1 carries and 3.5 targets per game last year. Still, he ranked among the top nine fantasy RBs for the second straight season. The situation couldn't be more different with the Texans, who led the NFL in snaps last season and emphasize the running game. Miller has to prove he can handle a 20-plus-touch workload and can make a major contribution as a receiver, but added usage should make Miller a legit RB1.
Fri, Jul 15
	199.7
Mark Ingram, NO RB [Breaking Video] 		BUNA			
Oak
	Sun 1:00		
During his first 50 NFL games, Ingram totaled 64 targets. In 12 games last season, he racked up 60. He was already heavily involved on early downs and near the goal line (he averaged 15.7 carries per game over the past two years), so the boost in passing-down work pushed Ingram into the fantasy elite. Incredibly, Ingram never finished a week worse than 29th among RBs in fantasy points. Durability remains a concern: He has missed at least three games in four of his five seasons. But at age 26, Ingram is in his prime and locked in as New Orleans' every-down workhorse, making him a high-floor RB1.
Fri, Jul 15
	196.8
Doug Martin, TB RB		BUNA			
@Atl
	Sun 1:00		
After a resurgent 2015 campaign, Martin re-signed with Tampa Bay and will return as the team's lead back. He gained 1,673 yards from scrimmage and scored seven TDs last season to finish third among RBs in fantasy points, which was a major rebound from two down years. After picking up 1,926 yards and scoring 12 TDs as a rookie in 2012, Martin missed 15 games in 2013 and '14 and totaled just 1,080 yards and three TDs. So last year's turnaround was a welcome sight in Tampa. Martin is a solid producer, but durability remains a concern, so consider him a back-end RB1 option.
Fri, Jul 15
	187.2
Le'Veon Bell, Pit RB  P [Breaking News] 		MC			
@Wsh
	Mon 7:10		
Bell topped draft boards heading into last season but went on to appear in only six games due to a two-game suspension and a torn MCL and PCL in his right knee.'' This season, he is at risk of missing the first four weeks due to a suspension.'' That's the bad news.' The good news is that Bell is currently helathy and when that was the case last season, he was extremely productive. Bell posted a top-20 fantasy week in each of his five full games. That's after finishing as a top-22 back in all but one of his 2014 appearances. If not for the suspension and the injury concern that still linger, Bell's heavy workload as a runner and receiver in Pittsburgh's high-powered offense would make him fantasy's top RB.

Thomas Rawls, Sea RB  P [Breaking News and Video] 		BAE			
Mia
	Sun 4:05		
Rawls was an undrafted rookie last year but took advantage of injuries to Marshawn Lynch to put up 830 rushing yards and four TDs on 147 carries. During the six weeks when he played at least half of Seattle's offensive snaps, only Devonta Freeman and Doug Martin scored more fantasy points among RBs. Not unlike Lynch, Rawls is a bruiser who figures to do his damage on early downs and at the goal line: Of his NFL-best 5.6 ypc, 2.7 yards came after contact (first in the league). Only a slow recovery from the broken ankle he suffered in December could stand between Rawls and superstardom.
Fri, Jul 15
	175.7
C.J. Anderson, Den RB		HB			
Car
	Thu 8:30		
A popular first-round pick in 2015 fantasy drafts, Anderson disappointed, but a slow start and personnel mismanagement were the primary culprits. During the first six weeks of the season, Anderson managed only 180 yards on 67 carries and failed to score a touchdown. Fifty-seven running backs had more fantasy points. During the final 11 weeks of the regular season, though, Anderson averaged 6.4 ypc, which included 2.8 after contact. Both were tops at the position. Denver matched Miami's expensive offer sheet to retain Anderson, which suggests he's in line for a big workload and a breakout season.
Fri, Jul 15
	174.5
Carlos Hyde, SF RB [Recent News] 		BUNA			
LA
	Mon 10:20		
Hyde is a prime example of a terrific player who can't seem to stay on the field. He has already missed 11 games in two years, including nine last season. When active, he has averaged 4.1 ypc, 2.5 of which came after contact (second in the NFL). He might get a boost from Chip Kelly's arrival too. Hyde faced a defense with fewer than five DBs on 88 percent of his carries last year, but Kelly's Eagles RBs ran against a base D just 41 percent of the time. Hyde's durability and limited work on passing downs are concerns, but his efficiency cannot be ignored. He's a solid RB2 with breakout upside.
Fri, Jul 15
	173.3
Eddie Lacy, GB RB [Breaking News] 		akc			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
After going first overall in plenty of fantasy drafts, Lacy was a massive disappointment last season. He was out of shape and ended up playing only 40 percent of the team's offensive snaps, sharing time with James Starks. After averaging 17.1 carries and 3.1 targets per game during his previous 31 games, Lacy averaged just 12.5 and 1.9 in 2015. Now 26, Lacy has vowed to be in shape for 2016, which makes sense, as it's a contract year. His massive ceiling keeps him in the RB1 mix, but obviously he's a risky investment.
Fri, Jul 15

Latavius Murray, Oak RB [Breaking News and Video] 		MC			
@NO
	Sun 1:00		
Murray's success in 2015 was a testament to the importance of durability and volume. In what was an injury-plagued season for Oakland at running back, Murray made it through 16 games as the team's workhorse. He finished the season third in carries, sixth in rushing yards and 11th in rushing TDs. His rate stats weren't quite as impressive; he averaged 4.0 ypc, including just 1.9 after contact. Murray posted only six top-20 weeks, making him a better flex option than RB2. He is still only 26 and is a size-speed freak, but he must fend off competition from rookie DeAndre Washington.
Fri, Jul 15
	158.9
Frank Gore, Ind RB [Recent News] 		MAN			
Det
	Sun 4:25		
Every year it seems Frank Gore is on the verge of falling off, yet he has finished as a top-20 fantasy running back for 10 straight seasons. He hasn't missed a game since 2010, including a 2015 campaign in which he handled 71.8 percent of the Colts' designed rushing attempts. Solid at the goal line, Gore leads all active players with 24 carries from the opponent's 1-yard line over the past five seasons. He remains extremely consistent, but he is now 33 and lacks a high ceiling.
Fri, Jul 15
	158.8
Jonathan Stewart, Car RB [Breaking News and Video] 		SHEA			
@Den
	Thu 8:30		
DeAngelo Williams' departure finally gave Stewart full ownership of the Carolina backfield last season, and he responded well. Despite missing three games, he ranked among the top 11 RBs in carries, rushing yards and rushing TDs. He powered his way to five top-10 weeks and finished no week ranked worse than 28th after Carolina's Week 5 bye. On the other hand, Stewart is 29 and has missed 23 games because of injury over the past four seasons. Owners need to weigh his lack of durability and passing-down involvement against his feature role in a dynamic offense, which leaves him as an RB2.
Fri, Jul 15
	158
Matt Jones, WAS RB		BAE			
Pit
	Mon 7:10		
Jones is in position to be the featured back in Washington but carries a ton of questions. As a rookie last season, he generated a few highlight-reel plays, but much of his production came off a few receptions that went for big gains. Jones actually struggled as a rusher, averaging just 2.5 ypc against base defenses (worst in the NFL). At 6-1, 231 pounds, Jones is supposed to be a physical runner, but he averaged just 1.5 yards after contact. His role as the team's starter is enticing, but he also has serious bust potential.
Fri, Jul 15
	154.2
DeMarco Murray, Ten RB [Breaking Video] 		BAE			
Min
	Sun 1:00		
Things couldn't have gone much worse for Murray in his lone season with the Eagles. He rushed for a career-low 3.6 ypc, including just 1.6 after contact, and ended up carrying the ball just 38 times in Philly's final five games. That was a far cry from Murray's four strong (albeit injury-plagued) seasons in Dallas. But life should be better in Tennessee. The Titans run a more conventional offense than Chip Kelly's scheme, in which Murray carried the ball from the shotgun 85 percent of the time. Rookie Derrick Henry is surely a threat on early downs, but Murray should be back in line for roughly 15 touches in a run-centered offense.
Fri, Jul 15
	150.4
Rashad Jennings, NYG RB [Recent News] 		HAN			
@Dal
	Sun 4:25		
Jennings was labeled the Giants' starter but spent most of last season in a four-man committee before finally being unleashed down the stretch. During the first 13 weeks, he averaged 21.9 snaps and 9.7 carries per game and was 43rd among running backs in fantasy points. During the final four weeks, though, he averaged 35.5 snaps and 19.8 carries and ranked third. Jennings is now 31 and might not be able to handle a workhorse role for a full season. But he remains the most talented RB on a good offensive team, which should allow him to post flexworthy stats.
Fri, Jul 15
	148.7
Matt Forte, NYJ RB  P [Breaking News and Video] 		MC			
Cin
	Sun 1:00		
Forte racked up an NFL-high 2,522 touches and 12,718 yards from scrimmage during his eight years with the Bears. He was on the field for 5,868 snaps, whereas no other RB exceeded 5,400. That's an impressive r'sum', but it also raises questions about whether Forte will hold up as he enters his age-30 season. Forte isn't very effective at the goal line or as a blocker, and he will cede snaps to Bilal Powell and Khiry Robinson. Still, he should get 15-plus touches per game in a Jets offense that finished sixth in snaps and in TDs last season, making him a solid RB2.
Fri, Jul 15
	147.8
Ryan Mathews, Phi RB		YU			
Cle
	Sun 1:00		
Mathews didn't play a lot in his first season with the Eagles, but he was easily the team's most effective RB. He averaged 5.1 ypc (sixth in the league), including 2.2 after contact (13th), but he was on the field for only 21 percent of Philly's offensive plays. With DeMarco Murray joining the Titans, Mathews should get a much heavier workload in 2016. But he has to show he can handle it: He was injury-prone in his five seasons with San Diego and missed three more games with the Eagles last year. Those doubts mean Mathews should be viewed as a fringe RB2.
Fri, Jul 15
	146.7
Jeremy Hill, Cin RB  P [Breaking Video] 		HAN			
@NYJ
	Sun 1:00		
Hill was a popular breakout candidate last year after a rookie campaign in which he ranked third among RBs in TDs and ninth in fantasy points. But he struggled badly with efficiency, averaging just 3.6 ypc last season. Only a position-high 11 rushing TDs--thanks to 13 carries within 3 yards of the goal line--bailed out Hill's owners. That goal-line load was the third highest in the NFL, so barring a major increase in effectiveness, Hill won't likely match his 12 overall TDs. He isn't much of a factor as a receiver either (20 targets last season), which leaves Hill as a risky RB2.
Fri, Jul 15
	144.1
Jeremy Langford, Chi RB [Breaking News] 		HAN			
@Hou
	Sun 1:00		
Longtime starter Matt Forte is now a Jet, which puts Langford in position to lead the Bears' backfield. Although volume breeds fantasy points, there are red flags. A 2015 fourth-round pick, Langford showed a few flashes as a rookie but mostly underwhelmed. He averaged 3.6 ypc, including 2.9 against base defenses (third worst in the NFL). According to Pro Football Focus, he forced only seven missed tackles on 148 rushes. Langford doesn't catch the ball consistently either (his 54 percent catch rate was worst among RBs), so he seems to be a better bet to lose the starting gig than to emerge as a fantasy star.
Fri, Jul 15
	143.2
Ameer Abdullah, Det RB  P		akc			
@Ind
	Sun 4:25		
Abdullah's performance as a rookie was underwhelming, but that was mostly the result of his being overhyped in the preseason. A second-round pick out of Nebraska, Abdullah picked up 597 yards on 143 carries for a healthy 4.2 ypc. Just 23 years old, Abdullah has the ability to make explosive plays and is the most talented RB on Detroit's roster. But Stevan Ridley could take away some of his early-down work, and theo Riddick has the third-down role locked up. Abdullah, then, is far from a safe investment, but he has the upside you want in a midround flier.
Fri, Jul 15
	140.1
Arian Foster, Mia RB [Breaking News] 		SHEA			
@Sea
	Sun 4:05		
Another year, another injury. Foster has missed 23 regular-season games over the past three seasons, including 12 last year, which led the Texans to release him this past winter. When healthy, Foster has been one of the league's most effective backs, having finished as a top-five fantasy RB in four of the past six seasons. But last year was a struggle, with just 163 yards on 63 carries--that 2.6 ypc ranked last among RBs who rushed at least 50 times. Foster is now 30, and while he figures to latch on with a team this summer, his days of carrying the load are over.
Fri, Jul 15
	139.9
Duke Johnson Jr., Cle RB [Recent News] 		RS			
@Phi
	Sun 1:00		
Johnson had little chance to succeed as a rookie. He was stuck in a dysfunctional offense with a carousel of replacement-level QBs and had to share duties as part of an RB committee. Still, he managed to make a mark as a pass-catching specialist, hauling in 61 receptions, which ranked fourth among RBs. Johnson played only 522 snaps and carried just 104 times for 379 yards, so there's a hint of breakout potential if he gets more work. More likely, he seems destined for a career as a third-down back and should be a fringe RB2 in PPR formats.
Fri, Jul 15
	137.5
Melvin Gordon, SD RB [Breaking Video] 		MAN			
@KC
	Sun 1:00		
Forty-one RBs racked up at least 111 carries during the 2015 regular season. Gordon was the only one who failed to score a rushing TD. That wasn't the extent of his rookie-year struggles: He also averaged just 3.5 ypc, second worst among RBs with at least 100 carries. But the Chargers' O-line was largely to blame, as Gordon forced 34 missed tackles, per Pro Football Focus, ninth among RBs. Gordon also caught 33 of his 37 targets. Danny Woodhead will again take away touches, but Gordon--the 15th pick in the 2015 draft--does enter 2016 as the team's lead back and early-down workhorse.
Fri, Jul 15
	135.2
Danny Woodhead, SD RB [Breaking News] 		BAE			
@KC
	Sun 1:00		
Woodhead is arguably the league's best pass-catching RB and led the position in targets, receptions, receiving yards and receiving TDs last season. That's how he ranked 11th among RBs in fantasy points despite carrying the ball just 98 times. There's a reason for the lack of rushes: Woodhead averaged just 3.4 ypc (third worst in the NFL) despite 61 percent of his carries coming against a nickel or dime defense. He averaged a league-worst 0.9 yards after contact. Woodhead is now 31, but his role as one of Philip Rivers' top targets is secure and makes him a fringe RB1 in PPR leagues.
Fri, Jul 15
	134.7
Giovani Bernard, Cin RB [Recent News] 		MC			
@NYJ
	Sun 1:00		
If there's one thing you can say about Bernard, it's that he's consistent. During his three seasons in the league, he has ranked 29th, 25th and 28th in carries and 16th, 18th and 21st in fantasy points among RBs. Bernard also cracked the top-10 RB list in targets, receptions and receiving yards, and his 4.8 ypc ranked 12th. But his strong play was somewhat overshadowed by Jeremy Hill's struggles in Cincinnati. Bernard is entering a contract year but will still be asked to complement Hill, which limits his ceiling. Still, he's a worthwhile RB2 in PPR.
Fri, Jul 15
	134.6
Dion Lewis*, NE RB  O		FA			
@Ari
	Sun 8:30		
Lewis suffered through four injury-plagued seasons before finally emerging as a fantasy asset in New England last season. During the seven weeks he was active, Lewis accrued 234 rushing yards on 49 carries and 388 receiving yards on 50 targets, ranking fourth among RBs in fantasy points (second in PPR). With LeGarrette Blount likely to handle most of the work between the tackles, Lewis is in position for a significant role on passing downs. His durability remains a major concern, but Lewis will be operating in one of the league's top offenses. He belongs in the RB2 mix and has RB1 upside in PPR leagues.
Fri, Jul 15
	131.2
LeGarrette Blount, NE RB		CHUN			
@Ari
	Sun 8:30		
Although he has never quite maintained a featured role, Blount has been one of the NFL's most efficient backs since entering the league in 2010. Including the playoffs, Blount has racked up 945 carries (18th most) over the past six years. His average of 2.35 yards after contact trails only Adrian Peterson's among 65 RBs with at least 350 carries during that span, and his 4.6 ypc ranks 10th. Blount isn't much of a receiver and is 29, but he's been underused throughout his career. Back with New England, he should see action on early downs and at the goal line and is a flex candidate in standard leagues.

Derrick Henry, Ten RB [Breaking Video] 		FA			
Min
	Sun 1:00		
The 2015 Heisman Trophy winner landed with the Titans with the 45th pick in April's draft. Henry is an absolute tank at 6-3, 242 pounds, but he also sports impressive speed (4.54 40-yard dash) and athleticism for his size. Still, he obviously projects as a power back, which means he'll be busy on early downs and at the goal line. That's good news in terms of TD upside, but it's unlikely he will do much on passing downs, which limits his upside, especially in PPR formats. As a rookie, Henry will work behind DeMarco Murray, likely limiting him to flex production.
Fri, Jul 15
	123.8
T.J. Yeldon, JAC RB		JSBS			
GB
	Sun 1:00		
After rushing for 740 yards as a rookie, Yeldon looked like a breakout candidate for 2016. Then Jacksonville signed Chris Ivory as a free agent to put a damper on that outlook. Still, there are reasons to like Yeldon. He touched the ball 218 times in the 12 weeks he was healthy, and he ranked 11th among RBs in fantasy points during that span. He had only three TDs, but that total was depressed by the Jaguars' unusually high rate of scoring by the pass (88 percent). He should find the end zone more this season and projects as an excellent midround target with upside.
Fri, Jul 15
	121.7
Chris Ivory, JAC RB		AN			
GB
	Sun 1:00		
Ivory is fresh off a career year in which he busted loose for 1,287 yards from scrimmage and eight TDs on 277 touches. But he's moving from a primary role with the Jets to a situation in Jacksonville where he will split carries with T.J. Yeldon. Ivory, 28, is more experienced and a better blocker than the 22-year-old Yeldon, and since he entered the league, Ivory's 4.6 ypc ranks ninth among the 49 RBs with 500-plus carries. But Yeldon is the same size, plays a similar game and is a superior receiver. Even if Ivory ends up as the leader of that tag-team backfield, his fantasy upside will be limited by Yeldon's presence.
Fri, Jul 15
	120.2
Justin Forsett, Bal RB		BAE			
Buf
	Sun 1:00		
After a breakout campaign in 2014 during which he finished eighth among RBs in fantasy points, the question was whether Forsett could sustain his success in 2015. He didn't. Forsett's yards per carry dropped from 5.4 to 4.2, his TDs fell from eight to two and he broke his arm in November, knocking him out for the rest of the season. He still tops the Ravens' depth chart, but the journeyman will turn 31 in October and must fend off Kenneth Dixon, Javorius Allen and Lorenzo Taliaferro for snaps. Initially Forsett will flirt with RB2 numbers, but he's far from a lock to hold down lead-back duties all season.
Fri, Jul 15
	118.3
Isaiah Crowell, Cle RB  P [Recent News] 		AN			
@Phi
	Sun 1:00		
Operating as the thunder to Duke Johnson's lightning in Cleveland last season, Crowell racked up 888 yards and five touchdowns on 204 touches. He averaged a substandard 3.8 yards per carry and failed to impress after contact. Crowell has posted a total of four top-10 weeks during his two seasons. At only 23 years old, he is the favorite to handle early-down and goal-line duties in Hue Jackson's run-first scheme, so he's worth a flier, as there's still a chance he takes a step forward. But the better bet is that he continues to play second fiddle to Johnson.
Fri, Jul 15
	116.5
Charles Sims, TB RB [Breaking News] 		RS			
@Atl
	Sun 1:00		
Doug Martin gets the headlines, but a case could be made that Sims was the better RB in 2015. In fact, Sims was one of the best backs in the entire league. Operating as the passing-down complement to Martin, Sims posted 1,090 yards and four TDs (all receiving) on 158 touches. He finished among the top 11 RBs in targets, receptions, receiving yards, receiving TDs, yards per catch and yards after contact (2.3 per rush). Sims--at worst--should have a similar role this season, and Martin's durability is always a concern. So target Sims in the middle rounds and give him a big boost in PPR leagues.
Fri, Jul 15
	113.4
Bilal Powell, NYJ RB		SHEA			
Cin
	Sun 1:00		
A complementary back throughout his career, Powell was on the fantasy radar in 2012 and 2013 but took a back seat to Chris Johnson and Chris Ivory in 2014. With Johnson out of the picture last season, Powell's playing time rebounded, and his efficiency was the best of his career. That helped Powell to a top-14 finish in targets, receptions, receiving yards and receiving TDs at the position. Now behind Matt Forte on the depth chart, Powell figures to struggle for touches out of the gate, but he'll be in position for a prime role should the overworked 30-year-old go down with an injury. Powell is a worthwhile late-round target.
Fri, Jul 15
	113
Theo Riddick, Det RB		MAN			
@Ind
	Sun 4:25		
Running backs with only 43 carries are rarely relevant in fantasy, but Riddick was an exception last season because of his pass-catching prowess. He finished 19th among RBs in PPR scoring despite producing just three TDs because he tied for first among RBs in receptions, placed second in targets and receiving yards and tied for seventh in receiving TDs. The former sixth-round pick lacks a high ceiling in non-PPR leagues, posting just two top-20 weeks last year, but his solid floor puts him in the RB2 mix in PPR.
Fri, Jul 15
	112.2
Darren Sproles, Phi RB		YU			
Cle
	Sun 1:00		
One of the game's best-ever passing-down specialists, Sproles has been on the field for roughly a third of his team's offensive snaps during five of the past seven seasons. Last season he ranked fourth among RBs in targets and sixth in receptions but only 14th in receiving yards. He can expect similar usage this year, despite the Eagles' coaching change. Sproles doesn't carry the ball a lot, and for good reason--he averaged just 3.8 yards per rush last season despite often running against nickel and dime defenses. At 33, Sproles has a low ceiling, but he could catch 50 passes.
Fri, Jul 15
	98.4
Shane Vereen, NYG RB		RS			
@Dal
	Sun 4:25		
After four seasons as the passing-down specialist in New England, Vereen signed with the Giants and assumed the same role. He performed admirably even though there wasn't a significant amount of fantasy value for him to accrue. He didn't run the ball much but averaged a respectable 4.3 yards per carry. He was busy in passing situations, though, as New York called pass on 84 percent of his 400 snaps. Vereen finished among the top six backs in targets, receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. He will have a similar job in 2016 and is worth flex consideration in PPR leagues.
Fri, Jul 15
	97.4
DeAngelo Williams, Pit RB		CHUN			
@Wsh
	Mon 7:10		
Eyeing some quality depth behind Le'Veon Bell last offseason, the Steelers signed Williams. The move certainly paid dividends last season as, dealing with a suspension and injury, Bell appeared in only six games, and is slated to miss the first four weeks of the 2016 season due to another suspension. Williams averaged 17.8 carries and 4.1 targets during his 10 starts last season, easily pacing the position in fantasy points during those 10 weeks. On the season, he racked up 11 rushing touchdowns and 15 carries within 3 yards of the goal line, both of which were most in the league. Williams is 33 years old and may not see the field much when Bell is healthy, but assuming the Steelers do not bring in another back, he can step in as a starter to start the season before being relegated to the role of a high-end handcuff.
Fri, Jul 22
	96
Tevin Coleman, Atl RB  P [Recent News] 		BAE			
TB
	Sun 1:00		
Coleman appeared ready for fantasy stardom at the start of last season. The Falcons' third-round pick won the starting job and rushed 20 times for 80 yards in the team's opener. Then he suffered a rib injury in Week 2, and Devonta Freeman not only ran away with the lead-back gig but also led all RBs in fantasy points. But Coleman could answer back this season. For one thing, his 4.7 ypc against base defenses ranked 11th in the league, while Freeman was just tied for 27th (4.0 ypc). Coleman has a good shot to pick up more carries this season, and at worst he projects as a high-end handcuff.
Fri, Jul 15
	89.4
Jerick McKinnon, Min RB [Recent News] 		FA			
@Ten
	Sun 1:00		
With many starters going down with injuries and others ineffective, 2015 was a good year for handcuff RBs. Adrian Peterson was one of only a few starters who held up for the entire season, however, which didn't allow the talented McKinnon to emerge until late in the season. Amid a small sample of work, the 2014 third-round pick impressed, averaging 5.2 ypc (fourth best) and scoring three TDs. McKinnon will start 2016 behind the 31-year-old Peterson, who just completed the sixth 300-plus-touch season of his career. McKinnon is one injury away from RB1 consideration and among the most interesting handcuffs in fantasy.
Fri, Jul 15
	85.9
C.J. Prosise, Sea RB  P [Breaking News] 		FA			
Mia
	Sun 4:05		
Prosise is considered raw, having played only one season at running back while at Notre Dame. Of course, his previous experience as a wide receiver speaks to his pass-catching ability, making him a strong complement to early-down back thomas Rawls. The third-round pick is 6 feet, 220 pounds and blazed a 4.48 40-yard dash. He averaged 6.6 yards per carry last year, and an impressive 24 percent of his attempts went for 10 yards or more. Prosise needs to clean up his fumbles and pass blocking, but he's an intriguing handcuff who also has some stand-alone PPR value as a rookie.
Fri, Jul 15
	85
James Starks, GB RB [Recent News] 		akc			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
He was initially ticketed strictly for change-of-pace work, but Starks' 2015 role grew significantly once it became apparent that Eddie Lacy couldn't carry the load. Starks ran the ball 148 times and averaged a solid 4.1 ypc, and he also finished among the top 18 RBs in targets, receptions, receiving yards and receiving TDs. Starks was an unreliable fantasy source, though, as he spread a trio of top-10 weeks over the entire season and managed only one additional top-20 week. Green Bay will put Lacy in position to reclaim feature-back duties, but it's no certainty that he will. This makes Starks a fine late-round flier.
Fri, Jul 15
	82.3
Jordan Howard, Chi RB [Recent News] 		FA			
@Hou
	Sun 1:00		
Jeremy Langford will get the first crack at replacing Matt Forte in Chicago, but he wasn't very impressive as a rookie. Enter Howard, the Bears' fifth-round pick out of Indiana. At 6-1, 230 pounds, Howard is a between-the-tackles bulldozer who will do a lot of damage after contact, making him a good fit in John Fox's run-heavy scheme. Howard converted 32 percent of his carries into first downs and ran for zero or negative yards on only 10 percent of his rushes last season. Both are terrific rates. If Langford stumbles early, watch for Howard to snatch his job.
Fri, Jul 15
	81.8
Shaun Draughn, SF RB		HB			
LA
	Mon 10:20		
Playing on his fifth team in as many seasons, Draughn finally got a long look as a feature back in 2015. The results weren't promising. He averaged just 3.5 ypc filling in for Carlos Hyde and Reggie Bush, including only 1.5 after contact. He didn't post a single top-10 week and ranked among the top-20 fantasy RBs just once. Draughn did show some receiving skills, though, hauling in 27 of 35 targets for 176 yards. This season he will compete with Kelvin Taylor and Mike Davis for reps behind Hyde.

Devontae Booker, Den RB [Breaking News] 		FA			
Car
	Thu 8:30		
Booker will be an ideal backup to C.J. Anderson as a rookie and is a potential three-down back in the future. He is effective running downhill at 5-10, 208 pounds, is comfortable catching passes out of the backfield and is a quality pass blocker. Booker lacks top-end speed and explosion, as only 34 percent of his runs went for at least 5 yards during his final season at Utah. He might not play much early, but he's an Anderson injury away from a significant role in Denver's run-heavy offense. Stash him on your bench.

Jay Ajayi, Mia RB [Recent News] 		RS			
@Sea
	Sun 4:05		
Ajayi was initially considered a top fantasy prospect entering his rookie year but plummeted down draft boards because of concerns about his knee. He then went on to miss half the 2015 season because of cracked ribs and finished with just 277 overall yards and one TD. Ajayi is a talented runner and a competent receiver, but he stands 6 feet and 228 pounds, so pass-blocking is a concern. With only receiving specialist Kenyan Drake in the mix, though, Ajayi has a chance to bust out as Miami's clear early-down back.
Fri, Jul 15

Tyler Ervin, Hou RB [Breaking News] 		FA			
Chi
	Sun 1:00		
Houston was eyeing a versatile complement to Lamar Miller when it selected Ervin in the fourth round of April's draft. Although he is tough and aggressive, Ervin doesn't have the size to hold up as an every-down back; at 192 pounds, he's the lightest of all RBs who were drafted this year. On the plus side, he is one of the better, more experienced pass-catching backs among this year's rookies: His 45 receptions at San Jose State in 2015 led all drafted RBs. Ervin is also a good returner and flashed his athleticism with strong performances in the 40-yard dash, vertical jump and broad jump at the combine. He's a fine handcuff to Miller.

Terrance West, Bal RB [Breaking Video] 		FA

Spencer Ware, KC RB [Recent News] 		JSBS			
SD
	Sun 1:00		
Ware came into the league in 2013 as a fullback with Seattle, then sat out the 2014 season. But last year he re-emerged as a tailback with the Chiefs, and after injuries to Jamaal Charles and Charcandrick West, he burst onto the fantasy scene with 101 total yards and two TDs in a Week 11 win against San Diego. Ware averaged 5.6 yards per carry, including an NFL-best 3.3 yards after contact, and scored six TDs. He certainly made a case for a larger role, but Charles is back, and even if Charles' recovery from ACL surgery is slow, Ware must beat out West.
Fri, Jul 15
	64.7
Javorius Allen, Bal RB [Breaking Video] 		RS			
Buf
	Sun 1:00		
A 2015 fourth-round pick, Buck played sparingly early last year but was the biggest benefactor when Justin Forsett went down for the season with an injury. During the final seven weeks, his 3.5 yards per carry was ugly, but a position-high 37 receptions was enough to rank sixth among RBs in fantasy points. Allen appears best served as a backup, but he'll have an opportunity to compete with the 30-year-old Forsett and rookie Kenneth Dixon in Baltimore's underrated offense. Since he is facing so much competition, Allen is nothing more than a late-round lottery ticket.
Fri, Jul 15
	64.5
Paul Perkins, NYG RB [Recent News] 		FA			
@Dal
	Sun 4:25		
The Giants nabbed the 5-11, 210-pound scat back in the fifth round of the draft. Although Perkins might not have the size or strength needed for an every-down role at the NFL level, he showed impressive elusiveness at UCLA. According to Pro Football Focus, he forced 73 missed tackles as a rusher last season, which trailed only Derrick Henry among FBS backs. Rashad Jennings is 31 and has trouble staying healthy, so Perkins could end up starting a few games as a rookie.
Fri, Jul 15
	63.9
DeAndre Washington, Oak RB [Recent News] 		FA			
@NO
	Sun 1:00		
Washington will be one of the shortest players in the league. But don't let that 5-7 frame distract you from his impressive strength (24 bench-press reps, second among RBs at the combine) and quickness (4.20 short shuttle, the fastest). Washington was a quality rusher at Texas Tech and especially dangerous as a receiver: He racked up 1,877 yards and 16 touchdowns on 274 touches last season. Expect him to play a significant role for the Raiders as a rookie. At the very least, he will complement Latavius Murray.
Fri, Jul 15

Josh Ferguson, Ind RB [Recent News] 		FA			
Det
	Sun 4:25			62.7
Ka'Deem Carey, Chi RB  Q		FA			
@Hou
	Sun 1:00		
Carey has played little in two seasons with the Bears, but he might have a shot at a larger role in 2016. He has been limited to just 169 snaps since Chicago drafted him in the fourth round in 2014. Now that Matt Forte is with the Jets, Carey will compete for snaps with the unproven Jeremy Langford and rookie Jordan Howard. In limited work, Carey has a career average of 4.0 yards per carry and has scored three TDs on 87 touches. He's smaller than his competition and not particularly explosive, but he is young and certainly fresh after riding the bench for two seasons.
Fri, Jul 15
	60.3
Tim Hightower, NO RB		BUNA			
Oak
	Sun 1:00		
Hightower had been out of the league for three years before engineering one of the season's best comeback stories. He spent most of 2015 as a healthy scratch, but Mark Ingram's shoulder injury vaulted him into a prime role, and he ran with it. Hightower gained 456 yards on 96 touches and scored four TDs over the season's final four weeks, which left him trailing only David Johnson in running back fantasy points over that span. That success persuaded the Saints to re-sign him; he'll back up Ingram.
Fri, Jul 15

Chris Thompson, WAS RB		FA			
Pit
	Mon 7:10		
Thompson wasn't expected to make much of an impact last season behind Alfred Morris and Matt Jones, but he found his niche as the team's passing-down specialist. Washington called pass plays on 87 percent of his 282 snaps, which helped him rank among the top 20 RBs in targets, receptions, receiving yards and receiving TDs. At 5-8, 193 pounds, thompson doesn't have the size to be a three-down back, but he will flirt with PPR flex numbers if he hangs on to last season's role.
Fri, Jul 15
	55.7
Alfred Morris, Dal RB [Recent News] 		BAE			
NYG
	Sun 4:25		
Since entering the NFL in 2012, Morris has led the league with 1,078 carries. He ranks second in rushing yards (4,713), fifth in rushing TDs (29) and eighth in fantasy points (668) at the position during that span. Although his efficiency has dipped (his yards per carry dropped to 3.7 in 2015), there's something to be said for Morris' durability. He didn't miss a game while with Washington. Morris now heads to Dallas, where he's set to compete for early-down and short-yardage work behind rookie Ezekiel Elliott. If he beats out Darren McFadden for the backup role, Morris will be a high-priority handcuff.
Fri, Jul 15
	53.6
Chris Johnson, Ari RB		AN			
NE
	Sun 8:30		
Johnson ranked 15th among RBs in fantasy points before breaking his leg in Week 12. That ended his season as well as his run as Arizona's starting running back; that job now belongs to David Johnson. Much of Chris Johnson's success last year was based on volume--he had the fourth-most carries in the league through the first 11 weeks. Still, he scored just three TDs and was targeted only 12 times in the passing game. If healthy, Johnson could be in the mix for some early-down carries, but that won't be enough to earn flex consideration.
Fri, Jul 15
	53.2
C.J. Spiller, NO RB  P [Breaking News] 		BAE			
Oak
	Sun 1:00		
Spiller has averaged 4.9 ypc since entering the league in 2010, the third-best mark among RBs with at least 400 attempts. Couple that with the fact that he was a top-10 draft pick and you'd expect him to be a star. Instead, Spiller has struggled with durability issues and hasn't come close to living up to expectations. It was more of the same during his first season as a Saint in 2015--he carried the ball only 36 times behind Mark Ingram. Spiller did catch 34 passes, but for all his ability, the 29-year-old doesn't figure to matter much in fantasy.

@Den
	Thu 8:30			52.2
Kenyan Drake, Mia RB  Q [Breaking News] 		FA			
@Sea
	Sun 4:05		
Drake was the third running back selected in April's draft, which was somewhat of a surprise. Although he figures to begin his career as a complement to Jay Ajayi as a receiving specialist, the Alabama product has the size (6 feet, 210 pounds), speed (4.45 40-yard dash) and elusiveness to potentially develop into an every-down back. At the very least, he should be a solid handcuff, and since he'll play a role similar to that of Charles Sims in Tampa Bay, he should also be considered a flex option in PPR leagues.
Fri, Jul 15
	50.5
Keith Marshall, WAS RB		FA			
Pit
	Mon 7:10		
Marshall fell to the seventh round of April's draft, but Washington's poor depth at running back behind Matt Jones (who struggled as a rookie) makes him fantasy-relevant. A combine standout, Marshall ran the fastest 40-yard dash (4.31) and posted the most reps on the bench press (25) among RBs. He was a five-star prospect out of high school but carries a major injury red flag after a torn ACL derailed most of his final three seasons at Georgia. Given his physical tools, though, Marshall should be on your radar in the later rounds.
Fri, Jul 15
	46.4
Benny Cunningham, LA RB [Recent News] 		FA			
@SF
	Mon 10:20		
Cunningham looked to be the odd man out of the Rams' backfield last season with the addition of Todd Gurley and the return of Tre Mason. But he ended up holding on to the passing-down role and caught 26 passes on 33 targets. He rushed only 37 times, which gives him little fantasy upside, but he does own impressive career averages of 4.3 yards per carry and 8.6 yards per reception. Gurley will continue to block Cunningham from grabbing a larger role, but it's worth monitoring his production in deep PPR leagues.
Fri, Jul 15
	45.7
Wendell Smallwood, Phi RB  P [Recent News] 		FA			
Cle
	Sun 1:00		
Stats aren't all that matter in football, but it's hard to argue with the numbers Smallwood produced at West Virginia. Last year he averaged 6.4 yards per carry (second best among drafted RBs), recorded a first down on 32 percent of his runs (second) and managed 5 or more yards on 51 percent of his carries (first). Smallwood is a bit lean at 5-11, 201 pounds, which hasn't allowed him to run with much power or pass-block with much success. But he is the next man up in the event of a Ryan Mathews injury in Philadelphia and is worth stashing on your bench.
Fri, Jul 15
	45.4
Karlos Williams, Buf RB  SSPD [Breaking News] 		HB			
@Bal
	Sun 1:00		
Williams scored nine TDs and averaged 5.6 ypc on 93 attempts as a rookie. Despite that impressive start to his career, he should take a step back in 2016. He remains the clear backup behind LeSean McCoy, and his TD rate is hardly sustainable. Should anything happen to McCoy, though, Williams will be poised to put up big numbers. The powerful back averaged 2.4 yards after contact last season, sixth in the league, and the Bills' productive offense relies heavily on the run. Williams' high ceiling makes him worth carrying on your bench, and he is a must-have handcuff for McCoy's owners.
Fri, Jul 15

Andre Ellington, Ari RB [Breaking News] 		HAN			
NE
	Sun 8:30		
Ellington has had several opportunities to emerge as Arizona's top RB since being drafted in the sixth round in 2013, but injuries have derailed his progress. Now those opportunities are all but gone: David Johnson has emerged as the Cardinals' clear starter, and Chris Johnson will also limit Ellington's playing time. Ellington actually played well in a small sample of work last season, averaging 6.4 yards per carry and 9.9 yards per reception. But he should see only occasional change-of-pace snaps this season and is worth attention only in deep leagues.

If you need another example of how well lead backs do in Andy Reid's offense, look to the West. After Jamaal Charles tore his ACL in Week 5, West morphed from an unknown reserve to a fantasy star. After a quiet first NFL start in Week 6, West finished among the top seven RBs in each of his next three outings. West's efficiency (4.0 ypc, including 1.6 after contact) wasn't special, but he rushed for 634 yards and scored five total TDs. West will be worth adding if Charles goes down again, but in that scenario, he's likely to share carries with Spencer Ware.

Cameron Artis-Payne, Car RB [Recent News] 		FA			
@Den
	Thu 8:30		
When the Panthers drafted Artis-Payne in the fifth round last year, they hoped he could help fill the void left by DeAngelo Williams. He showed some flashes, averaging 4.1 ypc on 45 attempts, but he couldn't move past journeyman Fozzy Whittaker as the top reserve behind Jonathan Stewart. Artis-Payne has some handcuff appeal this year, with the highest fantasy ceiling among Stewart's backups in one of the league's top offenses. But even in the event of an injury to Stewart, Artis-Payne likely would share snaps with Whittaker and Mike Tolbert.

Darren McFadden*, Dal RB  O		akc			
NYG
	Sun 4:25		
After an underwhelming seven-year tenure in Oakland, McFadden enjoyed a bit of a resurgence in Dallas last season. He averaged 4.6 yards per carry, which was third best among 24 backs with at least 180 carries. From Week 7 on, he handled 18.4 carries and 3.4 targets per game. Tony Romo's return will help Dallas' offensive efficiency, but with rookie Ezekiel Elliott and veteran Alfred Morris joining the team, McFadden simply won't see the field much. He is worth rostering only if he beats out Morris for No. 2 duties.

Stevan Ridley, Det RB		FA			
@Ind
	Sun 4:25		
After a productive four-year stint with New England, Ridley was limited to 81 snaps with the Jets last season. Now he will look for a fresh start in Detroit, where he will compete with Ameer Abdullah and Zach Zenner for early-down and goal-line work. Ridley has a career average of 4.2 yards per carry, but he isn't much of a receiver, which limits his upside. If he manages to earn 10 to 12 carries per game, he could generate some flex value, but that scenario is unlikely. Ridley should be owned in only the deepest of leagues.

Ronnie Hillman, Den RB  P [Breaking News] 		SHEA			
Car
	Thu 8:30		
Hillman finished 2015 as a top-20 fantasy RB, but that was more a product of volume than efficiency. Working in a committee with C.J. Anderson, Hillman ranked 12th in the league in carries and eighth in rushing touchdowns. Since entering the league in 2012, Hillman has averaged 1.4 yards per attempt after contact, which is second worst among active backs with at least 400 carries. Hillman likely will see a reduced role as a change-of-pace option behind Anderson and rookie Devontae Booker.

Khiry Robinson, NYJ RB  P		FA			
Cin
	Sun 1:00		
Robinson never got a ton of work during his three years in New Orleans, but he was reasonably impressive in his small sample of action. He gained 766 yards on 186 carries and scored eight TDs. Per Pro Football Focus, Robinson forced 34 missed tackles on 132 attempts over the past two seasons; only Carlos Hyde had a better rate among active RBs. Now with the Jets, Robinson appears to be buried behind Matt Forte and Bilal Powell, but it wouldn't be a surprise if he chipped in occasionally on early downs and at the goal line. Keep an eye on him.

Kenneth Dixon, Bal RB [Breaking Video] 		FA			
Buf
	Sun 1:00		
Dixon is one of the most intriguing additions to the fantasy landscape. At Louisiana Tech last year, he ran for zero or negative yards on one-quarter of his carries, which hardly seems like the r'sum' of a future pro. But considering that Dixon averaged just 1.2 yards before contact and 3.6 yards after contact (tops among RBs who attended the draft combine), it's plausible that offensive line woes caused those negative runs. That's what the Ravens believed after drafting him in the fourth round; he will provide them with a receiving threat and a potential heir to Justin Forsett.

Alex Collins, Sea RB [Recent News] 		FA			
Mia
	Sun 4:05		
If you're looking for a high-ceiling RB toward the end of your draft, Seattle is a good place to start. That brings us to Collins, the Seahawks' fifth-round pick in April out of Arkansas. At first glance, he appears to be buried on the depth chart, but thomas Rawls is recovering from a broken foot, and fellow rookie C.J. Prosise is raw. Collins has little experience as a receiver (13 receptions in 2015) and needs work as a blocker, but he is one injury away from a significant role in one of the league's most run-focused and highest-scoring offenses.

Alfred Blue, Hou RB  P [Breaking News] 		MAN			
Chi
	Sun 1:00		
Blue couldn't have landed in a better opportunity for playing time after the Texans took him in the sixth round of the 2014 draft. Arian Foster's frequent injuries have allowed Blue to rack up 1,448 yards and six TDs on 382 career touches. But he has been neither efficient--averaging 3.6 yards per carry, including 1.6 after contact--nor successful in fantasy (just six top-20 weeks in two seasons). Now Blue's opportunities will become less frequent: the durable Lamar Miller signed with Houston as a free agent, and he'll see the bulk of work at running back, leaving Blue to compete for scraps with rookie Tyler Ervin.

Zach Zenner, Det RB [Recent News] 		FA			
@Ind
	Sun 4:25		
Zenner had just started to earn playing time as an undrafted rookie when he was lost for the season in October with cracked ribs and a partially collapsed lung. But he will get another chance this year after Detroit released Joique Bell. Zenner has an impressive combination of size and speed that should allow him to compete for early-down and goal-line carries. Still, he will have to beat out Ameer Abdullah and Stevan Ridley, and theo Riddick already is entrenched as the team's top receiving back. Zenner is worth considering late in deep leagues, but Detroit's committee approach likely will limit his production.

Antonio Brown, Pit WR [Breaking News and Video] 		HB			
@Wsh
	Mon 7:10		
Brown was the top-scoring wide receiver in each of the past two years and has made a strong case that he is the most valuable asset in all of fantasy football. He trailed only Julio Jones in both targets (194) and receiving yards (1,834) last season and tied Jones for the league lead in receptions (136). Incredibly, Brown has finished a week among the top 10 WRs in fantasy points in nearly half of his outings over the past two seasons. As long as Ben Roethlisberger stays healthy, Pittsburgh's offense will be pass-heavy and among the best in the league. Brown is in his prime and has the highest floor at the position.
Fri, Jul 15

Julio Jones, Atl WR [Recent News] 		RS			
TB
	Sun 1:00		
The addition of offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan worked wonders for Jones last season. A third of the Falcons' passes went his way, enabling him to lead the NFL with 203 targets and 1,871 receiving yards and tie Antonio Brown with an NFL-high 136 receptions. All that's left is for Jones to find the end zone more often--he scored eight times last season. Durability remains somewhat of a concern for Jones, with 2015 marking only the second time in five seasons that he appeared in all 16 games. But that is a minor issue, as Jones remains a tremendous fantasy asset.
Fri, Jul 15

Odell Beckham Jr., NYG WR [Breaking News] 		BUNA			
@Dal
	Sun 4:25		
Beckham proved his rookie season was no fluke, ranking seventh in the league in targets (157), eighth in receptions (96), fifth in receiving yards (1,450) and tied for fourth in touchdowns (13) last season. That left him fifth in the league in fantasy points, and he might have placed second had it not been for the one-game suspension he earned after his contentious matchup with Josh Norman. Beckham is still only 23, but he is as heavily targeted and as dangerous after the catch as anyone in the league. He should be off the board early in the first round of your draft.
Fri, Jul 15
	205.4
DeAndre Hopkins, Hou WR [Breaking Video] 		MAN			
Chi
	Sun 1:00		
Hopkins became a full-fledged fantasy star in 2015, his third season in the league, ranking third in the NFL in targets (190), receptions (111) and receiving yards (1,521). He has excellent hands and is a threat on all levels of the field, but he simply doesn't offer much with the ball in his hands, averaging a position-low 1.8 yards after the catch. Brock Osweiler provides Houston with the quarterback upgrade it badly needed, so as long as Hopkins continues to flirt with a 30 percent target share, he will remain a strong WR1 option.
Fri, Jul 15
	198.2
A.J. Green, Cin WR [Recent News] 		BAE			
@NYJ
	Sun 1:00		
Cincinnati's improvement on offense last season actually meant less work for Green. After averaging at least 30 percent of Cincinnati's targets in games he played over the previous three seasons, Green's share fell to 26.8 percent in 2015. The Bengals simply had more options in an offense that averaged three TDs per game. As a result, he ranked 12th among WRs in receptions, eighth in yards, tied for seventh in TDs and eighth in fantasy points. Green will face a heavier burden this season, as both Mohamed Sanu and Marvin Jones departed as free agents. Regardless, you're sitting pretty if Green is your No. 1 WR.
Fri, Jul 15
	185.7
Alshon Jeffery, Chi WR  P		LEE			
@Hou
	Sun 1:00		
Jeffery missed seven games due to injury last season, but he was one of the most dominant WRs when active. He handled just under a third of the team's targets in games he played en route to 54 receptions for 807 yards and four TDs. Jeffery's size (6-3) makes him effective in the red zone: Only Calvin Johnson and Brandon Marshall had more end zone targets over the past three seasons. Jeffery has missed a hefty chunk of time during two of his four professional seasons, but he posted top-12 finishes during the other two campaigns. Consider him a borderline WR1 with top-five upside.
Fri, Jul 15
	180.7
Dez Bryant, Dal WR [Breaking Video] 		MAN			
NYG
	Sun 4:25		
You can pretty much write off Bryant's 2015 season. Injuries limited him to only nine games, and even when he was on the field, it was often as part of a Tony Romo'less offense. Bryant actually averaged 8.1 targets per game--almost as many as he had in 2014, when he caught a league-high 16 TDs and finished tied for third among WRs in fantasy points. In fact, Bryant entered the 2015 season having finished no worse than fourth at the position in TDs after his rookie season. With Romo back to full health, Bryant is a strong bet to regain elite status and is a borderline first-round pick.
Fri, Jul 15

Brandon Marshall, NYJ WR		MC			
Cin
	Sun 1:00		
Marshall consistently has been one of the league's top targets near the goal line. He either led the NFL or tied for the lead in end zone targets in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015, and he was fourth in 2014. Last season all those looks paid off: His 14 touchdowns tied Allen Robinson and Doug Baldwin for most in the league. Marshall also proved to be extremely reliable in his first season as a Jet. He finished no worse than 24th among WRs in fantasy points in all but two of his 16 outings last season. Marshall is now 32, but he has shown no signs of slowing down.
Fri, Jul 15
	175.8
Jordy Nelson*, GB WR  O		FA			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
Nelson missed the entire 2015 season with a torn ACL, and it was no secret that he was sorely missed. After scoring 3.3 TDs per game in 2014, Green Bay's offense posted a pedestrian 2.5 mark last season. Nelson finished among the top six receivers in targets, receptions, yards and TDs in 2014, which led to a third-place finish in fantasy points. Two years later, he carries more risk--he is 31 years old and coming off a serious injury. Still, Nelson is a good bet to handle eight to 10 targets per game in an Aaron Rodgers'led offense, making him a fringe WR1.
Fri, Jul 15
	171.4
Allen Robinson, JAC WR		AN			
GB
	Sun 1:00		
Robinson was a popular breakout candidate in 2015, and boy did he live up to the hype. In just his second season, he tied for the league lead with 14 touchdowns, and his 1,400 receiving yards ranked sixth in the NFL. Blake Bortles looked for him often near the goal line, as Robinson caught an NFL-high 11 end zone targets. But he also proved to be a major deep threat--he posted the seventh-highest average depth of target (15.3 yards) among WRs and the sixth-highest yards per reception (17.5). TD regression should be expected, but Robinson is only 23 and a rising star in Jacksonville's emerging offense.
Fri, Jul 15
	168.6
Mike Evans, TB WR		YU			
@Atl
	Sun 1:00		
Evans' first two seasons serve as further evidence that scoring touchdowns is more related to opportunity and good fortune than skill. He caught only two of 15 end zone targets in his second year compared with 10 of 19 as a rookie--research shows that those rates are almost entirely luck-based. In all, he was limited to three TDs, while he led the league with 11 drops. Evans is only 23, he is heavily targeted (especially deep down the field) and his 6-foot-5, 231-pound frame guarantees a ton of work near the goal line. Add in Jameis Winston's expected improvement and Evans is a solid WR2 with a huge ceiling.
Fri, Jul 15
	168.3
Sammy Watkins, Buf WR [Recent News] 		akc			
@Bal
	Sun 1:00		
Watkins was a fantasy star in 2015, but it might not seem like it because he missed nearly a quarter of the season due to injuries. During the 12 full games he played, Watkins handled 27.8 percent of Buffalo's targets and ranked sixth among WRs in fantasy points. He also posted the highest average depth of target (16.8 yards) in the NFL among players targeted at least 70 times. He should be back by training camp from a broken foot that required surgery in April. And with the emerging Tyrod Taylor under center in an offense that quietly was tied for eighth in TDs last season, Watkins is a borderline WR1 with an extremely high ceiling.

Decker has ranked among the top 10 wide receivers during three of the past four seasons, making him one of the most underrated players in fantasy. The definition of consistent, he posted a top-30 WR week in all 15 of his games last season. Decker ended up with 80 receptions, 1,027 yards and 12 TDs. There was nothing fluky about that TD total: He was targeted within 3 yards of the goal line a league-high 27 times and racked up 20 end zone targets, third most in the NFL. On draft day, consider Decker a safe WR3 target.

T.Y. Hilton, Ind WR  P [Breaking News] 		BUNA			
Det
	Sun 4:25		
Compare Hilton's 2014 and 2015 stats and you'll see how badly the Colts missed Andrew Luck. Hilton finished 15th among wide receivers in targets in both seasons. But last season, his receptions, yardage, TDs, catch rate, yards per reception and fantasy points all declined from 2014. Why? A whopping 28.5 percent of balls thrown in Hilton's direction were off target, more than double his 2014 rate of 13.3 percent. So with Luck back this year, you can bank on Hilton's resurgence. The 26-year-old deep threat should post WR2 numbers.

Keenan Allen, SD WR [Recent News] 		FA			
@KC
	Sun 1:00		
Allen missed 10 games because of injury over the past two seasons, delaying what seemed like a surefire rise to the upper echelon of the wide receiver rankings. When healthy, Allen has been a tremendous asset. As a rookie in 2013, he finished 17th among wide receivers in fantasy points. Through eight weeks last season, Allen ranked seventh in standard leagues and fourth in PPR and posted top-11 outings four times. But after lacerating his kidney in Week 8, Allen missed the rest of the season. With Philip Rivers still under center, a healthy Allen should bounce back in a big way this season.

Brandin Cooks, NO WR		CHUN			
Oak
	Sun 1:00		
After entering last season with expectations for a breakthrough campaign, Cooks looked like a bust early on. Through Week 4, he had 20 catches for just 215 yards and no touchdowns, leaving him tied for 50th among WRs in fantasy points. From that point forward, though, the 2014 first-round pick was a revelation. Cooks scored a TD on nine of his next 64 receptions, and only 13 players ended up topping his total of 1,138 receiving yards. Cooks is only 22 years old, and his star is still on the rise. He's an explosive playmaker in Drew Brees' high-octane attack, making him a strong option as a WR2.

Amari Cooper, Oak WR		akc			
@NO
	Sun 1:00		
Cooper had quite the volatile rookie campaign after being the first receiver taken in the 2015 draft. He started strong and faded late (partially because of a foot injury), but he ended up among the top 25 receivers in targets, receptions, yardage, touchdowns and fantasy points. On the negative side, Cooper dropped 10 passes, which trailed only Mike Evans for most in the league. Still, Cooper is only 22 and already a proven every-down contributor. With his high talent level and a role in a quality offense, Cooper is a strong candidate for a big step forward in 2016, making him a solid WR2 with massive upside.

Julian Edelman, NE WR [Recent News] 		HB			
@Ari
	Sun 8:30		
Edelman would be in the WR1 conversation if not for his injury issues. He has emerged as Tom Brady's favorite receiver, averaging 9.4 targets per game over the past three seasons. (Rob Gronkowski sits at 8.5 during the same span.) But Edelman has played a full 16-game slate just once in his career and appeared in only nine games last season. He scored seven times in that limited run, though, and finished as a top-13 WR during four of those weeks. Edelman is a high-floor WR2 target, especially in PPR.
Fri, Jul 15

Demaryius Thomas, Den WR [Recent News] 		MC			
Car
	Thu 8:30		
Thomas ranked among the top nine WRs in receptions and yardage in each of the past four seasons and joined Julio Jones and Antonio Brown as the only players to catch 100 passes in both 2014 and 2015. But last season, he dropped nine passes (third most in the NFL) and posted his worst fantasy finish (13th) since 2011. At age 28, thomas remains in his prime, but Denver's shaky QB situation--combined with Gary Kubiak's run-first scheme--means his efficiency and volume could very well take another step back. He is now more of a middle-of-the-pack WR2 than the solid WR1 he was during the Peyton Manning era.

Randall Cobb, GB WR  P [Recent News] 		HAN			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
Cobb looked like a lock for WR1 production last season after Jordy Nelson tore his ACL. Instead, he struggled with consistency like the rest of the Green Bay offense and took a big step backward in terms of efficiency: Cobb's catch rate fell from 73 percent to 62 percent, and his yards per reception dropped from 14.1 to 10.5. Nelson's return figures to give the Packers' offense a boost, but Cobb will be hard to trust after laying an egg when he was presented with such a great opportunity. Cobb is only 26 and has Aaron Rodgers under center, but he should still be viewed as a WR3.
Fri, Jul 15

Jarvis Landry, Mia WR		HAN			
@Sea
	Sun 4:05		
Landry took a big step forward as Ryan Tannehill's top target in 2015. After catching 84 passes as a rookie, he bumped up that total to 110 last season, which ranked fourth in the league. The problem is that the bulk of those catches came close to the line of scrimmage: He posted a lowly 7.2-yard average depth of target and caught only four TD passes. New coach Adam Gase should help the Dolphins' talented offense become even more productive, though. And even if Landry continues to be used primarily on short routes, he is a safe pick as a WR3 and becomes a borderline WR1 in PPR formats.
Fri, Jul 15

Jeremy Maclin, KC WR [Recent News] 		CHUN			
SD
	Sun 1:00		
Maclin signed with Kansas City last offseason, there were serious concerns that Alex Smith's conservative play would crush the veteran receiver's fantasy value. Instead, the underrated Smith force-fed the ball to Maclin, helping his new favorite target post nine top-30 weeks, including four top-10s. Maclin saw fewer deep shots than he did in the Philly offense, but he still managed to score eight TDs while eclipsing 1,000 receiving yards. At 28, Maclin remains in his prime, but durability is a slight concern. He has appeared in all 16 games only twice in his seven-year career. Maclin is a WR3, and his ceiling is low.

Doug Baldwin, Sea WR [Recent News] 		AN			
Mia
	Sun 4:05		
After scoring a total of 15 TDs in his first four seasons, Baldwin exploded for 14 in 2015, which tied for the league lead. Incredibly, through Week 11 Baldwin had scored only three times and ranked tied for 34th among WRs in fantasy points. Over the next six weeks, 11 of his 34 catches went for TDs, and he was fantasy's top performer at the position. Baldwin's TD pace is unsustainable, but his breakout was inevitable. A terrific blocker and efficient receiver, he has been one of the NFL's top all-around WRs for years but had struggled to find targets in Seattle's run-heavy offense. Consider Baldwin a fringe WR2.
Fri, Jul 15

Kelvin Benjamin, Car WR [Breaking News and Video] 		akc			
@Den
	Thu 8:30		
the Carolina offense enjoyed a breakout 2015 campaign, but imagine how much better it could have been with its No. 1 receiver. After an impressive rookie campaign in which Benjamin posted 1,008 receiving yards, he tore his ACL last August. During his big rookie season, the 6-foot-5, 245-pound Benjamin scored nine TDs thanks to an NFL-high 24 end zone targets. Expect him to slide comfortably back into his role as Cam Newton's go-to wide receiver and become one of the few players in the league with the potential for 12-plus TDs.

Golden Tate, Det WR [Recent News] 		SHEA			
@Ind
	Sun 4:25		
Calvin Johnson's shocking decision to retire should benefit Tate. Back in 2014, the Lions played five games in which Johnson was sidelined or limited. During those weeks, Tate totaled 39 receptions for 599 yards and three TDs. Only four wide receivers scored more fantasy points. Even with Johnson in the mix last season, Tate racked up 128 targets (18th among WRs) and 90 catches (ninth). Tate is primarily a short-area target, but high volume in Detroit's pass-heavy offense will allow WR3 production. Just don't expect him to score a lot of touchdowns.
Fri, Jul 15
	137.3
Emmanuel Sanders, Den WR [Recent News] 		BAE			
Car
	Thu 8:30		
Sanders was the victim of poor QB play last season. He dropped from fourth in receptions among WRs in 2014 to 20th last season, fell from fifth to 14th in yardage and from tied for 12th to tied for 23rd in TDs, despite being targeted only six fewer times. The problem was that 26.7 percent of balls thrown his way were off target, compared with 19.1 percent in 2014. The Broncos' unsettled QB situation spells more trouble, and it's likely Gary Kubiak will revert to a run-first scheme without Peyton Manning. Target volume thus becomes a concern in addition to efficiency, leaving Sanders as a WR3.
Fri, Jul 15

Larry Fitzgerald, Ari WR		CHUN			
NE
	Sun 8:30		
After failing to reach 1,000 yards for three straight seasons, Fitzgerald bounced back to finish 10th among WRs in fantasy points last year. Look closer, though, and 2015 resembles two distinct seasons for Fitz. Through the first five weeks, he ranked first among WRs in fantasy points on the strength of 35 receptions, 490 yards and six TDs. After, he had 74 catches for 725 yards and three TDs, which left him 34th. Fitzgerald is 33, and while he should remain a fantasy starter, he likely won't repeat his WR1 performance, with David Johnson, Michael Floyd and John Brown taking on increased work.
Fri, Jul 15
	134.7
Donte Moncrief, Ind WR [Recent News] 		SHEA			
Det
	Sun 4:25		
The 2015 season was a tale of two halves for Moncrief. After seven weeks, he ranked 21st among WRs in fantasy points and had 34 catches for 381 yards and five TDs. But over his final nine games, Moncrief caught only 30 passes for 352 yards and one score, making him fantasy's No. 68 wide receiver. Of course, he was playing without Andrew Luck for most of that stretch. The former third-round pick will be just 23 years old to start the season and should be the Colts' No. 2 WR opposite T.Y. Hilton. Now that Luck is back, Moncrief should vault into WR3 consideration.
Fri, Jul 15
	134.5
John Brown, Ari WR  P [Breaking News] 		MC			
NE
	Sun 8:30		
Brown has emerged as one of the league's most explosive deep threats, posting a top-10 average depth of target in each of his first two seasons. Despite being used in a boom-or-bust role, he was more consistent than you might expect. Brown managed only one top-10 week among WRs but placed inside the top 30 in two-thirds of his appearances (tied for ninth among WRs). For the season, he finished in the top 30 in targets, receptions, yardage and TDs. Still on the rise at age 26 and blessed with 4.3 speed, Brown should put together another WR3 campaign.
Fri, Jul 15
	134.1
Michael Crabtree, Oak WR [Recent News] 		LEE			
@NO
	Sun 1:00		
Just when his career seemed to be on its last legs, Crabtree was reborn in Oakland. In six seasons with the 49ers, he ranked among the top 30 WRs in fantasy points just once. But with the Raiders last season, he ended up 19th. Crabtree saw plenty of targets (10th among WRs), particularly in the end zone, where the Raiders went to him 15 times (tied for 10th in the league). His strong 2015 performance makes Crabtree a clear flex option this season, but he likely will play second fiddle to the emerging Amari Cooper.
Fri, Jul 15

Michael Floyd, Ari WR		MAN			
NE
	Sun 8:30		
Injuries before and during the season--hamstring, knee, fingers--quelled optimism for a fourth-year breakout and led to another pedestrian campaign for Floyd. He ended up 32nd among WRs in fantasy points, but he did manage six top-25 finishes during his 15 games. At 26, Floyd now enters a contract year. He carries some risk and will compete for Carson Palmer's attention with Larry Fitzgerald and John Brown, but it's not out of the question for him to emerge as the No. 1 receiver in Arizona's high-scoring offense. He has the high ceiling you want in your third receiver.
Fri, Jul 15

Jordan Matthews, Phi WR  Q		JSBS			
Cle
	Sun 1:00		
Matthews was a disappointment for most of his second season after posting solid numbers as a rookie, but he salvaged it somewhat with a strong finish. He ranked among the top 15 wide receivers just once in the first 14 weeks but placed among the top eight in each of the final three weeks. It will be hard for Matthews to continue his late-season momentum, though, as he transitions from Chip Kelly's fast-paced attack to Doug Pederson's more traditional scheme. Pederson's use of two-TE sets will force Matthews to play outside of the slot more often, which likely will chip away at his efficiency.
Fri, Jul 15

Marvin Jones, Det WR		BUNA			
@Ind
	Sun 4:25		
Jones heads to Detroit after spending his first four years in Cincinnati. He missed all of 2014 because of foot and ankle injuries but sandwiched two productive seasons around that lost year. In 2013, he caught 51 passes for 712 yards and 10 TDs. Last season he had 65 receptions for 816 yards and four scores. Although Jones won't make anyone forget Calvin Johnson, he will find ample opportunity for success in Detroit as the primary downfield threat in a pass-heavy offense. Consider him a flex option.
Fri, Jul 15

DeVante Parker, Mia WR [Breaking News and Video] 		RS			
@Sea
	Sun 4:05		
June foot surgery, coupled with Miami's deep wide receiver unit, almost led to a lost rookie season for Parker, but the 14th pick in the 2015 draft finished strong. During Weeks 12 to 17, Parker caught 22 of 40 targets for 445 yards and three scores, tying for 19th among WRs in fantasy points. On the season, he averaged 10.5 yards per target, which was sixth among WRs with at least 30 targets. Parker is extremely talented, stands 6-foot-3 and has 4.4 wheels. Durability concerns aside, Parker is a strong bet to break out as Miami's top perimeter threat this season.
Fri, Jul 15

Kevin White, Chi WR [Breaking Video] 		FA			
@Hou
	Sun 1:00		
After the Bears traded Brandon Marshall to the Jets last offseason, they used the seventh pick in the draft to take White as his replacement. Things didn't quite go according to plan, as White missed the entire season with a shin injury. Finally back to full health, he has little competition for the team's No. 2 wide receiver gig opposite Alshon Jeffery. Armed with a 6-foot-3 frame, sub-4.4 speed and pro-ready skills as a run blocker (key in Chicago's ground-heavy scheme), White will quickly make a significant impact. The 24-year-old is an enticing sleeper with a massive fantasy ceiling.
Fri, Jul 15

DeSean Jackson, WAS WR		HB			
Pit
	Mon 7:10		
Jackson arguably has been the league's premier deep threat of the past decade, but durability issues continue to limit his production. He has appeared in all 16 games only twice in eight seasons, and he missed seven contests last year. When he played, though, he was effective: From Week 9 to Week 16 he caught 30 balls for 528 yards and four TDs. Only 17 wide receivers scored more fantasy points during that span. Kirk Cousins has, at the very minimum, solidified the team's QB situation, and Jackson remains one of his go-to targets. He is a boom-or-bust WR3.
Fri, Jul 15
	125.2
Tyler Lockett, Sea WR [Breaking Video] 		LEE			
Mia
	Sun 4:05		
Lockett was supposed to be a return specialist as a rookie but ended up becoming a reliable playmaker opposite Doug Baldwin. His 51 catches for 664 yards and six TDs left him tied for 38th among WRs in fantasy points, but a deeper look at his stats shows some serious upside. His 74 percent catch rate was seventh best among WRs, despite a high average depth of target (13.1 yards). The return of Jimmy Graham and Paul Richardson--plus the re-signing of Jermaine Kearse--limits Lockett's volume a bit. But he is worth a mid-to-late-round flier because of his potential for a second-year surge.
Fri, Jul 15

Sterling Shepard, NYG WR  P [Breaking News] 		FA			
@Dal
	Sun 4:25		
Shepard lacks high-end speed and is only 5-10 with short arms, so he isn't the most physically intimidating receiver around. But the Oklahoma product more than makes up for it with great hands, quickness and excellent route-running, which is why the Giants drafted him in the second round. Shepard figures to work all over the formation for the G-Men this season. The Giants had a third receiver on the field on 91 percent of pass plays last season, so Shepard is all but locked into a massive role as a rookie. He will also contribute as a returner, which adds a bit of value to his fantasy r'sum'.
Fri, Jul 15

Torrey Smith, SF WR [Breaking Video] 		FA			
LA
	Mon 10:20		
Despite signing a five-year, $40 million contract, Smith was rarely used during his first season with the 49ers. He saw only 59 targets, which led to 33 catches for 663 yards and four TDs. He did average 20.1 yards per reception to top the NFL. The biggest reason for optimism is the arrival of Chip Kelly and his fast-paced offense. Kelly helped coax big fantasy seasons out of DeSean Jackson in 2013 and Jeremy Maclin in 2014, but Nelson Agholor struggled as the Eagles' top perimeter WR last season. Still, Smith's big-play ability and his expected uptick in volume due to Kelly's scheme make him an interesting flex option.
Fri, Jul 15
	118.1
Michael Thomas, NO WR		FA			
Oak
	Sun 1:00		
When it comes to fantasy-friendly landing spots, they don't get much better than New Orleans. After cutting Marques Colston, the Saints drafted thomas in the second round. The former Buckeye has good ball skills, and at 6-3, 212 pounds, he should see plenty of targets near the goal line. Thomas is not quite speedy enough to take the top off defenses (4.5 in the 40), so a majority of his impact figures to come in the intermediate area. Thomas has a good shot to step right into Colston's old big-slot role, which allowed Colston to produce fringe WR2 stats for most of his tenure as a Saint.
Fri, Jul 15
	113.2
Allen Hurns, JAC WR [Breaking News] 		CHUN			
GB
	Sun 1:00		
Hurns was one of the more improbable breakout players in 2015. He ranked among the top 10 WRs five times (tied for fifth in the league), which helped him finish 14th in fantasy points at his position. Hurns dropped only one pass all season, and he was one of 10 WRs who scored at least 10 TDs. Jacksonville should be healthier--and better--on offense and likely will rely on the running game more than it did a year ago, so that could cost Hurns both targets and TDs. But he is only 24 years old, stands 6-foot-3 and plays nearly every down for an emerging offense. That's a lot to like.
Fri, Jul 15
	112.1
Willie Snead, NO WR [Breaking Video] 		AN			
Oak
	Sun 1:00		
With Jimmy Graham traded to Seattle and Marques Colston fading, Snead was presented with a rare opportunity to start in one of the NFL's best offenses as a second-year undrafted free agent. He didn't disappoint, finishing tied for 25th among WRs in catches and 24th in yards. His 69 percent catch rate (18th highest) was certainly helped by the presence of Drew Brees, but Snead dropped only two of his 100 targets. Also a quality blocker, he is the front-runner to start opposite Brandin Cooks. Even with rookie Michael thomas in the mix, Snead is well worth flex consideration in the Saints' high-volume attack.
Fri, Jul 15

Corey Coleman, Cle WR  P [Breaking News] 		FA			
@Phi
	Sun 1:00		
One of the fastest WRs in the rookie class, Coleman provides the Browns with an explosive playmaker. He averaged 18.4 yards per reception and caught an FBS-high 20 TDs (the next closest had 17) at Baylor in 2015. He is on the small side (5-11, 194 pounds), which might cost him scoring chances, and he will need to cut down on drops and improve his route-running, but his big-play ability and contributions as a rusher and returner will guarantee him a hefty role right away. The Browns, after all, badly need weapons, and Coleman could catch 70 passes and reach WR3 status.
Fri, Jul 15
	109.5
Vincent Jackson, TB WR		BUNA			
@Atl
	Sun 1:00		
The aging Jackson has faded into a secondary role behind Mike Evans. In his first three seasons in Tampa Bay, he didn't miss a single game and ranked among the top 11 WRs in targets each season. But last season he was sidelined for six games and saw his targets drop to just 6.7 per game during the weeks in which he played a full game. At 33, Jackson is no longer a fantasy star, but he should still start opposite Evans and can challenge defenses with his 6-foot-5 frame. He should be considered a flex option when he has a favorable matchup.
Fri, Jul 15
	108.6
Sammie Coates, Pit WR [Recent News] 		FA			
@Wsh
	Mon 7:10		
Coates basically redshirted as a rookie, playing in just six games and catching only one pass. But his snap count is sure to rise this season with Martavis Bryant facing a season-long suspension. Coates stands 6-foot-1, weighs 212 pounds, sports 4.43 speed and displayed impressive playmaking ability at Auburn. Even if Coates doesn't pass the underwhelming Markus Wheaton, he should be heavily involved as Pittsburgh's No. 3 WR. Considering the Steelers' recent success in developing mid-to-late-round receivers, Coates stands out as a high-ceiling target during the late stages of your draft.

Josh Gordon, Cle WR  SSPD [Breaking News] 		AN			
@Phi
	Sun 1:00		
While his indefinite suspension has been lifted, Gordon is still facing a four-game suspension to start the season. He has elite upside--he was fantasy's top-scoring wide receiver in 2013- but he carries obvious risk as well. Additionally, Cleveland's quarterback situation remains shaky, and Gordon is no longer necessarily the team's top receiver, with rookie first-round pick Corey Coleman joining the squad. Gordon's considerable potential makes him worth snagging, but not as one of your top two receivers.

Travis Benjamin, SD WR  P [Breaking Video] 		JSBS			
@KC
	Sun 1:00		
Benjamin's move to San Diego could be a blessing for his fantasy stock. The Chargers use plenty of three-WR sets, so he shouldn't have any trouble getting playing time alongside Keenan Allen and Stevie Johnson. That wasn't always a given in Cleveland. Benjamin was rarely used during his first three seasons there but found a niche in the offense last season and ranked 28th among WRs in fantasy points. The 5-foot-10, 175-pound speedster has the look of a boom-or-bust performer, but Allen and Johnson both have durability issues, making Benjamin worth a late-round pick.
Fri, Jul 15
	104.8
Tavon Austin, LA WR [Breaking News] 		MAN			
@SF
	Mon 10:20		
After two underwhelming seasons to start his career, Austin finally began to live up to his potential in 2015. Despite his small frame (5-8, 176 pounds), Austin managed to appear in all 16 games after missing a total of four during the previous two seasons. Though he was tied for only 40th in receptions and tied for 72nd in receiving yards, he added fantasy points in other areas. He returned a punt for a TD and led all WRs with 52 carries, 434 rushing yards and four rushing scores. Austin's versatility keeps him in the fantasy mix, but his unconventional role in a low-volume offense will limit his upside.
Fri, Jul 15

Steve Smith Sr.*, Bal WR  O		FA			
Buf
	Sun 1:00		
Smith turned back the clock early last season, posting 41 catches for 588 yards and three TDs in his first six games, which placed him 10th among WRs in fantasy points per game. But in his seventh game, he tore his Achilles, costing him the rest of the season. It also caused him to rethink his decision to retire: Smith will now try to return from that brutal injury at age 37, making him a risky pick. If he returns to full health and assumes an every-down role, he is talented enough to flirt with WR2 stats. The more likely scenario, though, is that he finishes his career playing in sub packages for Baltimore's suddenly deep offense.
Fri, Jul 15
	103.4
Terrance Williams, Dal WR [Recent News] 		RS			
NYG
	Sun 4:25		
Williams has yet to emerge as an impact receiver, despite playing 73 percent of all offensive snaps during his three years in the league. He has finished no better than 40th among WRs in fantasy points during those three seasons. The Cowboys used him primarily as a deep threat during his first two seasons (15.0-yard average depth of target), then shifted him to a more well-rounded role with Dez Bryant injured last season. Williams enters his first contract season as the favorite to start opposite Bryant, and Tony Romo's return will be just enough to make him a fine late-round sleeper.

Devin Funchess, Car WR [Recent News] 		AN			
@Den
	Thu 8:30		
Funchess failed to emerge as an every-down player as a rookie, but he impressed--for the most part--when called upon. He hauled in 31 of 64 targets for 473 yards and five TDs despite inconsistent playing time. Funchess is one of the league's biggest WRs (6-foot-4, 225 pounds), which would normally make him a lock for goal-line work. But he is actually playing alongside an even bigger target in the 6-5, 245-pound Kelvin Benjamin, who led the NFL in end zone targets as a rookie before tearing his ACL last year. Funchess will push Ted Ginn and Corey Brown for the starting spot opposite Benjamin.

Phillip Dorsett, Ind WR [Recent News] 		FA			
Det
	Sun 4:25		
Dorsett was the Colts' first-round pick last season but entered the year buried on the depth chart, then struggled along with the rest of the offense because of Andrew Luck's absence. If that wasn't bad enough, he also missed five games with an ankle injury. Things should get better in 2016. With the release of Andre Johnson, Dorsett is the heavy favorite to be the Colts' No. 3 WR behind T.Y. Hilton and Donte Moncrief. His 5-foot-10, 185-pound frame might limit his scoring chances, but Dorsett's 4.33 speed gives him the potential to make big plays. With Luck back under center, Dorsett is a fine late-round target.
Fri, Jul 15
	98
Will Fuller, Hou WR [Recent News] 		FA			
Chi
	Sun 1:00		
After selecting him 21st in April's draft, the Texans hope Fuller will become the NFL's next premier deep threat. Fuller's 4.3 40-yard dash was fastest among wide receivers who attended the combine, but his poor performance in other categories supported concerns that he is a one-trick pony. Fuller's hands need work (he led the FBS with 21 drops the past two seasons, per Pro Football Focus), and his lean frame makes him a liability as a blocker and against press coverage. Fuller must overcome these issues, but he is still likely to settle in as Houston's No. 2 receiver. Expect high-variance performances from the rookie.
Fri, Jul 15
	97.3
Markus Wheaton, Pit WR [Breaking News] 		FA			
@Wsh
	Mon 7:10		
Wheaton has yet to emerge as a starting-caliber receiver, but he'll get one more shot to prove his worth with Martavis Bryant suspended for the entire 2016 season. Wheaton has shown some flashes (see his nine-catch, 201-yard performance against Seattle last year), but he also failed to emerge during stints as the No. 2 WR in 2014 and during Bryant's 2015 suspension. If Wheaton beats out Sammie Coates for an every-down role opposite Antonio Brown, the volume alone in Pittsburgh's pass-heavy, high-scoring offense will allow him to produce flexworthy stats.
Fri, Jul 15
	97.1
Stefon Diggs, Min WR [Breaking Video] 		JSBS			
@Ten
	Sun 1:00		
Diggs couldn't have made much more of an impressive debut. He took the field for the first time in Week 4 and caught 25 passes for 419 yards and two TDs in his first four games. Only DeAndre Hopkins scored more fantasy points during those four weeks. But Diggs slumped after that, managing just 27 catches for 301 yards and two TDs (both in one game) the rest of the way. Considering the Vikings snagged him in the fifth round, they still got quite a return on their investment. But until they open up their offense, he is no more than flex material, especially with Laquon Treadwell now in the mix.
Fri, Jul 15
	96.5
Mohamed Sanu, Atl WR		FA			
TB
	Sun 1:00		
The Falcons were desperate for offensive weapons last season, so they dished out $32.5 million over five years to bring Sanu to town. The problem is that his r'sum' doesn't suggest that he can live up to the contract. In 2014, injuries to Cincinnati's receivers forced him onto the field for 93 percent of the team's snaps, but he underwhelmed with a 56-790-5 line and dropped seven passes. The Falcons' pass-first system and lack of receiver depth should ensure that Sanu sees lots of targets, but don't use anything other than a late-round pick on him.
Fri, Jul 15
	95.7
Kenny Britt, LA WR [Breaking News] 		FA			
@SF
	Mon 10:20		
Britt has been on the field for 77.6 percent of the Rams' pass plays over the past two seasons, but he hasn't made much of a fantasy impact. He caught only 36 passes last season but did manage 681 yards and three touchdowns thanks to a massive 16.1-yard average depth of target. Britt showed occasional fantasy value with Tennessee, where he spent his first five seasons--he gained 775 yards and scored nine touchdowns in 2010. But given the Rams' focus on the running game, he offers very little upside this season.
Fri, Jul 15
	95.6
Pierre Garcon, WAS WR		SHEA			
Pit
	Mon 7:10		
Garcon has--somewhat quietly--been a consistent fantasy contributor since entering the league in 2008. He has ranked 29th or better among WRs in receptions during five of the past six seasons. Garcon has never scored more than six TDs in a season--a mark he tied last year--but he did finish 2015 tied for 14th in the NFL with 13 end zone targets. He is a reliable possession receiver, but his upside is limited. With Josh Doctson challenging him for playing time in Washington, Garcon projects as little more than a bye-week fill-in.
Fri, Jul 15
	94.3
Laquon Treadwell, Min WR [Recent News] 		FA			
@Ten
	Sun 1:00		
The 23rd overall pick in April's draft, Treadwell heads to the Vikings, where he immediately steps in as the team's most talented wide receiver. Treadwell is big (6-2, 221 pounds) and strong, has long arms and is a quality blocker, which will help his chances of playing early. He is not a burner but will dominate in the intermediate areas with his body control, playmaking ability and post-catch production. The Ole Miss product might not have the same ceiling as Dez Bryant and DeAndre Hopkins, but his style is similar. Treadwell just turned 21, so he has plenty of room for growth.
Fri, Jul 15
	89.9
Kamar Aiken, Bal WR		JSBS			
Buf
	Sun 1:00		
Aiken hardly looked like a relevant fantasy player heading into last season, but he ended up tied for 21st in the league with 126 targets. That total included 84 after Week 9, which ranked fourth among WRs. Aiken finished the season with 75 receptions for 944 yards and five TDs and posted five top-30 fantasy weeks after Week 9, taking advantage of injuries to much of Baltimore's receiving corps. But he'll struggle to match that production now that the Ravens are flush with WR depth. Most likely, he will compete for snaps as Baltimore's No. 3 or No. 4 WR.
Fri, Jul 15
	87.9
Bruce Ellington, SF WR [Breaking News] 		FA			
LA
	Mon 10:20			85.2
Nelson Agholor, Phi WR [Breaking News] 		FA			
Cle
	Sun 1:00		
Agholor struggled as a rookie after the Eagles drafted him with the 20th pick. He missed three games because of a shin injury and wasn't a significant threat when healthy. Part of that was due to circumstance: With Jordan Matthews working out of the slot, Agholor played on the outside and ran more than three-quarters of his routes against a lineup of standout corners that included Patrick Peterson, Darrelle Revis and Malcolm Butler. Agholor isn't big, but he showed some burst after the catch. As a probable starter in Doug Pederson's new offense, he is a post-hype sleeper worth monitoring.
Fri, Jul 15
	83.5
Dorial Green-Beckham, Ten WR [Breaking News] 		AN			
Min
	Sun 1:00		
Green-Beckham started slowly as a rookie, which is understandable because he didn't play football at all in 2014. Considering his rust and QB Marcus Mariota's injury issues, his overall body of work wasn't bad: 32 receptions, 549 yards and four TDs. The former second-round pick improved his play late in the season, putting up a pair of 100-yard outings in the final five weeks. Green-Beckham is huge (6-5, 237 pounds), which gives him tremendous upside as an end zone target. His trade to the Eagles puts him in an offense that will maximize his size and matchup ability, and at age 23, he is a serious breakout candidate.
[Breaking News]
Tue, Aug 16
	83.4
Rishard Matthews, Ten WR [Recent News] 		JSBS			
Min
	Sun 1:00		
Matthews heads from Miami to Tennessee without much of a track record, having caught just 107 passes in four seasons. However, he might be capable of doing more: Last season he posted the 10th-best catch rate among WRs (72 percent) and was terrific after the catch (5.7 yac). The Titans needed serious help at wide receiver, so Matthews could challenge for a starting role. He has WR3 potential as a late-round pick, but with DeMarco Murray, Delanie Walker, Kendall Wright and Dorial Green-Beckham around, volume remains a question.
Fri, Jul 15
	82.6
Jaelen Strong, Hou WR [Recent News] 		FA			
Chi
	Sun 1:00		
Strong played sparingly as a rookie but provided some optimism that he can develop into a contributor at the NFL level. The third-round pick was targeted on 26 of his 294 snaps and caught 14 passes for 161 yards and three touchdowns. He is still a bit raw at age 22, but he stands 6-foot-2 and weighs 217 pounds, and Houston's upgrade to Brock Osweiler at QB will help his efficiency. Of course, the team's decision to draft both Will Fuller and Braxton Miller wasn't exactly a vote of confidence for Strong, and he will struggle to earn consistent snaps this season.
Fri, Jul 15
	80.7
Jermaine Kearse, Sea WR [Recent News] 		SHEA			
Mia
	Sun 4:05		
Kearse returns to Seattle as a candidate for the No. 2 role behind Doug Baldwin after signing a three-year extension this offseason. Considering the team's defense-first, run-heavy reputation, it may surprise you that Seattle ranked ninth in three-plus-WR sets and third in four-plus sets when passing last season. That will keep Kearse on the field, but the emergence of Tyler Lockett and the return of Jimmy Graham and Paul Richardson provide a significant blow to Kearse's fantasy ceiling. He is a better option for DFS tournaments--with his potential for an occasional big performance--than he is a strong season-long pick.
Fri, Jul 15
	79.8
Robert Woods, Buf WR		MAN			
@Bal
	Sun 1:00		
It seemed likely that Buffalo would look to upgrade at wide receiver during the offseason, but the team's biggest move was to spend a sixth-round pick on Kolby Listenbee. That puts Woods in position to start opposite Sammy Watkins. Woods has managed at least 80 targets in each of his first three seasons, but he has yet to finish a season better than 46th in fantasy points among WRs. In fact, he has managed only one top-10 fantasy week in his career. Woods is a short-range target who adds very little after the catch and is worth drafting only in the deepest of leagues.
Fri, Jul 15
	78.9
Breshad Perriman*, Bal WR  O [Breaking News] 		FA			
Buf
	Sun 1:00		
Knee troubles cost Perriman his entire rookie season after the Ravens took him in the first round of the 2015 draft. Now he has a chance to make a major impact. Steve Smith Sr., Mike Wallace and Kamar Aiken will challenge him for snaps, but Smith is 37 and coming off a torn Achilles, and Wallace struggled in Minnesota last year. Perriman's combo of size (6-2, 218 pounds) and elite speed gives him massive upside. The Ravens have added several offensive weapons, but Perriman has the highest fantasy ceiling on the team. Take a stab in the middle rounds and hope he comes close to reaching his vast potential.
Fri, Jul 15
	78.7
Josh Doctson*, WAS WR  O [Breaking News] 		FA			
Pit
	Mon 7:10		
The 22nd pick in April's draft, Doctson provides Washington with high-level athleticism and playmaking ability. His 120.6 receiving yards per game ranked second in the FBS in 2015, and while he doesn't have game-breaking speed, only a few WRs in this year's rookie class can match his ball skills and jump-ball ability. Doctson has excellent hands and will see plenty of deep balls on perimeter routes. Expect him to be busy near the goal line as well. The TCU product will start his career behind DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon, but even if you don't draft him, keep him in mind as a midseason buy-low target.
Fri, Jul 15
	78.4
Tyler Boyd, Cin WR [Breaking News and Video] 		FA			
@NYJ
	Sun 1:00		
Boyd, the Bengals' second-round pick out of Pittsburgh, is a natural fit to replace Mohamed Sanu. He is not particularly big (6-1, 197 pounds) nor fast (4.58 40-yard dash), but he can line up all over the formation and contribute as a receiver, rusher, returner and even as a passer. Given that versatility, Boyd might be better off in an offensive-weapon role as a rookie, especially because he ranked near the bottom of draft prospects in both average depth of target (9.4) and yards per reception (10.2). But the Bengals lack depth at WR, so Boyd will see plenty of action right away, making him a fine late-round option.
Fri, Jul 15
	77.9
Victor Cruz, NYG WR  P [Breaking News] 		FA			
@Dal
	Sun 4:25		
For Cruz, 2011 seems like ages ago. Back then, in his first year on the active roster, he finished as the No. 4 wide receiver in fantasy football. But he hasn't played a game since October 2014, when he tore his patellar tendon against the Eagles. Last year his comeback was derailed by a calf injury, and he missed the whole season. If healthy, Cruz has a shot to work the slot in Ben McAdoo's three-WR scheme, but he is no longer the Giants' top receiver and shouldn't be expected to reach his pre-injury form. Cruz has a WR3 ceiling, but he is too risky an investment before the final rounds of your draft.
Fri, Jul 15
	75.2
Anquan Boldin, Det WR [Recent News] 		YU			
@Ind
	Sun 4:25		
Boldin was far from a fantasy star during three seasons in San Francisco, but he was a solid option thanks to a steady workload. He averaged 7.8 targets per game, which helped him rank among the top 25 wide receivers in receptions during each season with the 49ers. Much of his low ceiling can be attributed to scoring 16 touchdowns over those three seasons, including a total of just nine over the past two years. Boldin figures to sign with a team this summer, but wherever he lands, he likely won't be a go-to receiver and thus is worth your attention only in the later rounds.
[Breaking News]
Tue, Aug 16
	75.1
Chris Hogan, NE WR [Breaking News] 		FA			
@Ari
	Sun 8:30		
The Patriots badly needed to upgrade their talent at wide receiver, so they snatched Hogan away from the Bills with a three-year, $12 million contract. Although Reggie Bush nicknamed him 7-11 because he's always open, Hogan's hands don't always cooperate. He dropped 8.5 percent of his targets last season, which was the worst rate among the 85 wide receivers who saw at least 50 passes. Still, if Hogan earns an every-down role in the Patriots' offense, he'll be a lock for fantasy relevance. He is well worth the cost of a late-round pick.
Fri, Jul 15
	71
Kendall Wright, Ten WR  P [Breaking News] 		BUNA			
Min
	Sun 1:00		
Wright has played a significant role in his four years with the Titans yet has never finished a season better than the No. 30 fantasy receiver. That is somewhat remarkable given that he finished 14th in the league in targets in 2013 (when he caught 94 passes for 1,079 yards but scored just twice). Wright has missed nine games due to injury in his career and has been used almost exclusively as a short-area target out of the slot. His low ceiling is a major concern, but as he enters a contract year in an improving offense, he shouldn't be ignored.
Fri, Jul 15
	70.3
Mike Wallace, Bal WR		HAN			
Buf
	Sun 1:00		
Wallace was a major disappointment in his only season in Minnesota and now joins his third team in as many years. After finishing no worse than 28th among WRs in fantasy points during his first six seasons, Wallace finished tied for 74th in 2015 with career lows in receptions (39), yards (473) and TDs (two). Now in Baltimore, Wallace will benefit from strong-armed Joe Flacco, but playing time could limit his fantasy upside. Wallace will compete with Steve Smith Sr., Breshad Perriman and Kamar Aiken for reps in a tight-end-friendly offense. There's WR3 upside here, but Wallace will be a risky choice from week to week.
Fri, Jul 15
	69.4
Jamison Crowder, WAS WR [Recent News] 		FA			
Pit
	Mon 7:10		
From Weeks 9 through 16, no Redskins wide receiver played more snaps than Crowder. He wasn't targeted as often as DeSean Jackson or Pierre Garcon, but the rookie from Duke settled into a comfortable role as Washington's primary slot receiver and finished the year with 59 receptions (37th among WRs). Jackson and Garcon return, and the Redskins selected Josh Doctson in the first round of April's draft. All that competition will limit Crowder to occasional targets out of the slot, and he won't see enough volume to allow for much fantasy production.
Fri, Jul 15
	67
Cole Beasley, Dal WR		FA			
NYG
	Sun 4:25			66.8
Albert Wilson, KC WR		FA			
SD
	Sun 1:00		
Wilson is far from the most exciting name in our rankings, but he can't be ignored after being on the field for 80.7 percent of the Chiefs' pass plays when active last season. He was limited to two top-30 fantasy weeks among wide receivers, but he averaged 6.3 yards after the catch (seventh highest in the league). He also didn't get much help from Alex Smith: 29 percent of balls thrown his way were off target (fifth highest). There's not a ton of upside here, but if the 24-year-old can fend off the likes of Chris Conley, Rod Streater and Demarcus Robinson, he should be a name to monitor in deep leagues.
Fri, Jul 15
	63.9
Ted Ginn Jr., Car WR		YU			
@Den
	Thu 8:30		
Ginn caught only 44 passes last year but scored 10 TDs, which tied for 10th in the NFL. His game revolves around the big play: His 16.5-yard average depth of target trailed only that of Sammy Watkins and Malcom Floyd for the NFL lead. But he posted an ugly 47 percent catch rate because of shaky hands (7.4 percent drop rate, tied for fourth worst in the league) and inaccurate throws (32 percent of balls thrown his way were off target, second highest). If Ginn can't beat out Devin Funchess and Corey Brown behind Kelvin Benjamin, he'll struggle to see anything more than the rare deep shot. Aim higher in the mid-to-late rounds.
Fri, Jul 15
	63.9
Davante Adams, GB WR		HB			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
Adams appeared to be a lock for a breakout campaign after Jordy Nelson tore his ACL in the preseason. Instead, the team's 2014 second-round pick was a major bust, missing three games due to injury, dropping six passes and averaging a miserable 5.4 yards per target. Only five WRs have more drops since he entered the league. Green Bay's reliance on three-WR sets benefits Adams, but his inefficiency makes him far from a lock to beat out Ty Montgomery, Jeff Janis and Jared Abbrederis for snaps. There is some appeal for any WR in an Aaron Rodgers offense, but Adams' floor is extremely low.
Fri, Jul 15
	63.2
Seth Roberts, Oak WR		FA			
@NO
	Sun 1:00			59.6
Chris Conley, KC WR [Recent News] 		FA			
SD
	Sun 1:00		
Conley's production was low as a rookie, but late in the season the Chiefs delivered a preview of how they might use him this year. They shifted Jeremy Maclin into the slot with greater frequency, which gave Conley more snaps on the perimeter. Expect that trend to continue as the Chiefs hope to take advantage of his 6-foot-2 frame and 4.35 40-yard speed. Those raw skills, plus the Chiefs' need for another playmaker, make him a sleeper to target toward the end of your draft.
Fri, Jul 15
	57.2
Brandon LaFell, Cin WR  Q [Breaking News] 		BAE			
@NYJ
	Sun 1:00			56.1
Leonte Carroo, Mia WR		FA			
@Sea
	Sun 4:05		
Carroo will start his career buried behind Jarvis Landry and DeVante Parker on Miami's depth chart after the Dolphins took him in the third round of April's draft. He doesn't stand out for his size (6 feet, 211 pounds) or speed (4.5 40-yard dash), but he is a well-rounded receiver with solid hands, good routerunning ability and excellent ball skills. Carroo also went deep frequently at Rutgers--he averaged a massive 20.7 yards per reception in 2015. Carroo will have to fight for No. 3 duties with Kenny Stills this season, making him a better dynasty prospect than a short-term fantasy asset.
Fri, Jul 15
	55
Justin Hardy, Atl WR		FA			
TB
	Sun 1:00		
Hardy didn't see the field until Week 8 after the Falcons drafted him in the fourth round, but he went on to catch 21 passes for 194 yards. His 4.56 40-yard time is slow for a wide receiver--especially one who is 5-foot-10 and 192 pounds--but he worked primarily from the slot at East Carolina and played a similar role with the Falcons last season. Atlanta signed Mohamed Sanu to complement Julio Jones, but the former Bengal has been decidedly mediocre in his career. That puts Hardy in position to grab a significant role in the Falcons' offense.

Rashad Greene, JAC WR		FA			
GB
	Sun 1:00			50.3
Kenny Stills, Mia WR		FA			
@Sea
	Sun 4:05		
Greg Jennings and Rishard Matthews are gone, but Stills' push for playing time won't be any easier with rookie Leonte Carroo joining the Dolphins. Stills is primarily a situational deep threat. His 16.5-yard average depth of target ranked fourth in the league last season, but his 44 percent catch rate was fourth worst. The Dolphins had a third wide receiver on the field on 82 percent of their pass plays last year, which ranked fifth in the league. New head coach Adam Gase has a history of using his personnel similarly, so Stills could see plenty of snaps if he can hold off Carroo.

Ty Montgomery, GB WR  P		FA			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
Jordy Nelson's torn ACL exposed Green Bay's lack of depth at the skill positions last season, which opens the door for Montgomery to emerge in 2016. The third-round pick played sparingly as a rookie but likely would've seen an expanded role down the stretch if not for an ankle injury that cost him 10 games. More of a receiver/back/returner hybrid, Montgomery might never develop into anything more than a gadget player. But Green Bay's depth issues and heavy use of three-WR sets (93.6 percent of the team's pass plays last season) make him worth a late-round pick.

Jeff Janis, GB WR  D [Breaking News] 		FA			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
Despite injuries to Jordy Nelson and Ty Montgomery and Davante Adams' struggles, the Packers steadfastly refused to promote Janis last season. That was the case until the playoffs, at least, when Janis lit up the Cardinals for seven receptions, 145 yards and two TDs. Now 25, Janis will compete again with Adams, Montgomery and Jared Abbrederis for targets in one of the league's most WR-friendly offenses. The output will be sporadic, but Janis will flirt with flex numbers if he nails down the No. 3 receiver job.

The 49ers took Smelter in the fourth round of the 2015 draft, but a torn ACL cost him his entire rookie season. The former Georgia Tech receiver is 6-foot-2, 227 pounds, and he is dynamic with the ball in his hands. The 49ers' receiver situation is wide open after Torrey Smith, which gives Smelter a chance to earn significant playing time as a de facto rookie. Monitor his progress throughout training camp, and if he pushes toward the top of the team's depth chart, consider grabbing him in the later rounds of your draft.

The Jets had a very specific role for Smith as a rookie: Go deep. His 19.9-yard average depth of target was the highest among WRs who equaled or exceeded his 28 targets. He caught only nine of those passes for 115 yards and a TD, then tore his ACL in December, so he will likely start the season on the PUP list. If healthy, he could push for the No. 3 WR job, which is a key role with the Jets: they ranked third in the NFL in three-WR sets (89 percent of plays) and easily topped the NFL in four-WR looks (51 percent). Still, Smith must prove he can do more than run an occasional deep route to be fantasy-relevant.

Miller was one of the most fascinating prospects in April's draft. He moved to WR as a senior after playing QB for three years at Ohio State, so he projects as more of an offensive weapon than a prototypical WR at the NFL level, at least at first. But he has vast potential because he is an electric athlete: Miller is 6-foot-1 and dominated the agility drills at the combine, topping all WRs in both the short and long shuttle. He will compete with Cecil Shorts and Jaelen Strong for time at WR, but as a gadget player, he figures to contribute more to the Texans than he will to your fantasy team.

Mitchell is interesting primarily because of where he landed in the draft. The high-scoring Patriots took him in the fourth round, and Mitchell's versatility (he can play on the perimeter and in the slot) makes him a good fit in their offense. Mitchell helped his stock greatly at the combine: He measured with the biggest hands, ran a 4.45 40-yard dash and posted one of the longest broad jumps. At 24, he is a bit older than most rookies, and at 6 feet and 198 pounds, he is on the small side. If he manages to leap ahead of Chris Hogan, Nate Washington and Danny Amendola for snaps, though, he'll become a must-own player.

After four spotty years with the Giants, Randle heads to the division-rival Eagles hoping to offer more production. He has never finished better than 29th in fantasy points among WRs, although his rank did improve in each season with the Giants. On the plus side, Randle has never missed a game due to injury, and he was on the field for at least 92 percent of the Giants' pass plays in each of the past two years. Randle is still just 25, but a lack of progress in a full-time role with Eli Manning doesn't bode well for what he'll do with the Eagles and their muddled QB situation.

Broncos D/ST D/ST		LEE			
Car
	Thu 8:30		
Denver was easily 2015's top-scoring fantasy D/ST, but the season was more a tale of two halves than it was a consistent run of dominance. The Broncos finished each of their first eight games among the top seven fantasy defenses, but from that point on, they were limited to two top-10 weeks and ranked 12th overall. The early-season schedule is rough (they open with the Panthers, Colts and Bengals), and the losses of Malik Jackson and Danny Trevathan are massive, but with Von Miller leading the way, this remains a talented and deep group that should take only a small step back.

Bengals D/ST D/ST		CHUN			
@NYJ
	Sun 1:00		
Cincinnati's ball-hawking secondary consistently has kept the Bengals near the top of the fantasy rankings in recent years, but change has come to that group. The Bengals have picked off at least 20 passes for three straight seasons and have ranked as a top-10 fantasy D/ST in four of the past five seasons. But S Reggie Nelson and CB Leon Hall are gone, putting the onus on recent draft picks Shawn Williams, William Jackson III and Darqueze Dennard to replace them. The front seven remains talented, and if the new defensive backs do their jobs, this unit should remain one of the league's best.
Fri, Jul 22
	123.3
Panthers D/ST D/ST		BUNA			
@Den
	Thu 8:30		
The Panthers rode big plays to a fourth-place finish in fantasy points last season, their second top-five ranking in three years. They led the NFL with 24 interceptions, 22 forced fumbles and 15 fumble recoveries. Their secondary took a hit in the offseason with the losses of Josh Norman, Charles Tillman and Roman Harper, but defensive standouts Luke Kuechly, Thomas Davis, Shaq Thompson and Charles Johnson will keep this unit among the best in the NFL. The Panthers should also benefit from a season-opening slate that includes the low-scoring Broncos, 49ers, Vikings, Falcons and Bucs.
Fri, Jul 22

Packers D/ST D/ST		MAN			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
Green Bay's D/ST has finished in the top half of the NFL in fantasy points for nine of the past 10 seasons, including last year's 13th-place ranking. Big plays fueled the success in 2015: The Packers placed ninth in interceptions (16) and seventh in sacks (43) and tackles for loss (100). The team lost CB Casey Hayward to free agency and DT B.J. Raji to a 'hiatus' this offseason, but the Packers have plenty of depth at corner to replace Hayward and drafted Kenny Clark in the first round to take Raji's spot. The LB level is weak, but the Packers should be able to put together another top-half season in 2016.
Fri, Jul 22
	120.4
Cardinals D/ST D/ST		HB			
NE
	Sun 8:30		
The Cardinals have become a reliable D/ST, having finished no worse than 13th in fantasy points over the past six seasons. That includes last year's third-place ranking, when they led the league in non-offensive TDs (seven) and forced fumbles (22). With Calais Campbell, Patrick Peterson and Tyrann Mathieu leading the way, they also ranked among the top five teams in interceptions, fumble recoveries and yards allowed. Newcomers Chandler Jones and Tyvon Branch add firepower to a unit that should start strong against the (Tom Brady'less) Patriots, Buccaneers, Bills, Rams and 49ers.
Fri, Jul 22
	119.7
Jets D/ST D/ST		MC			
Cin
	Sun 1:00		
Players and coaches have come and gone, but one thing has remained constant for the Jets: They don't let opponents gain many yards. The Jets have ranked no worse than 11th in yards allowed over the past seven seasons, including fourth last year. The loss of run-stopping NT Damon Harrison hurts, but newcomer Steve McLendon adds to a dominant D-line that includes Muhammad Wilkerson, Sheldon Richardson and Leonard Williams. The LBs are unproven, though, and Darrelle Revis is the only sure thing at cornerback--those concerns are strong enough to limit the Jets to the fringe of top-10 status.
Fri, Jul 22
	117.1
Chiefs D/ST D/ST		RS			
SD
	Sun 1:00		
After an underwhelming first month, the Chiefs were nothing short of dominant in the final three quarters of the 2015 season. They ranked outside of the top 12 D/STs only once in that span and finished the season with a league-high 11 top-10 fantasy weeks. The Chiefs scored six TDs, ranked second in INTs and were third in points allowed. To maintain their elite status, they must overcome the departures of Sean Smith, Mike DeVito and Tyvon Branch, as well as Justin Houston's ACL injury. But the likes of Eric Berry, Marcus Peters and Tamba Hali are well suited to do just that.
Fri, Jul 22
	116.1
Texans D/ST D/ST		BAE			
Chi
	Sun 1:00		
The Texans started slowly but finished strong last season, posting seven top-eight fantasy weeks in their final nine outings. They led the league with 90 passes defensed and finished seventh or better in sacks, tackles for loss, yards allowed and points allowed. The 2016 schedule presents a greater challenge, with matchups against the NFC North, AFC West, New England and Cincinnati. Of course, with J.J. Watt leading a unit that includes Vince Wilfork, Jadeveon Clowney, Whitney Mercilus, Johnathan Joseph and 2015 first-round pick Kevin Johnson, Houston's D/ST remains among the best in the game.
Fri, Jul 22
	115.2
Seahawks D/ST D/ST		CHUN			
Mia
	Sun 4:05		
Seattle's recent run of defensive dominance has translated to the fantasy world as well: The Seahawks have finished among the top five teams in D/ST rankings in each of the past five seasons. They have allowed the fewest points in the league four years running and have finished no worse than second in yards allowed for three straight seasons. Don't expect a downfall this year, as the intimidating core that includes Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas, Kam Chancellor and Bobby Wagner remains intact. Plus, the Seahawks will benefit from an early-season slate that features the Dolphins, Rams and 49ers.
Fri, Jul 22

Bills D/ST D/ST		AN			
@Bal
	Sun 1:00		
After finishing 2014 as fantasy's top-scoring D/ST, the Bills fell all the way to 22nd last season. The main culprit? A dip from 54 sacks and 103 tackles for loss in 2014 (both tops in the league) to 21 sacks (second fewest) and 61 TFLs (fewest) in 2015. Mario Williams is gone, after never feeling comfortable in Rex Ryan's system, and Nigel Bradham departed as well, but Buffalo spent its top three draft picks on pass rusher Shaq Lawson, LB Reggie Ragland and DT Adolphus Washington. Lawson, though, underwent shoulder surgery in May and won't return until midseason. The Bills should be solid but unspectacular this season.
Fri, Jul 22

Raiders D/ST D/ST		FA			
@NO
	Sun 1:00		
Looking for a sleeper D/ST? Check out the Raiders. They added LB Bruce Irvin, CB Sean Smith, S Reggie Nelson and rookie S Karl Joseph to a unit that posted eight top-10 fantasy weeks (tied for fifth) last season. Oakland finished just 22nd overall in points and yards allowed but tied for first in the NFL with five blocks and was in the upper half in most fantasy-relevant categories. The Raiders still must fill a few holes, but with the additions joining gap clogger Dan Williams, resurgent CB David Amerson and, of course, All-Pro pass rusher Khalil Mack, they are headed in the right direction.
Fri, Jul 22
	110.4
Rams D/ST D/ST		SHEA			
@SF
	Mon 10:20		
After the offseason losses of James Laurinaitis, Rodney McLeod, Nick Fairley, Janoris Jenkins and Chris Long, the Rams' D/ST looks poised to decline for the third straight season. It was the seventh-best fantasy unit in 2013, tied for eighth in 2014 and 12th last year. The Rams aren't completely devoid of talent, though: Aaron Donald leads a dominant D-line that also includes Robert Quinn, William Hayes and Michael Brockers. But there are questions beyond Alec Ogletree, Mark Barron and Trumaine Johnson on the second and third levels. The schedule is also tough, so look elsewhere for a starting D/ST.
Fri, Jul 22
	110.2
Ravens D/ST D/ST		FA			
Buf
	Sun 1:00		
Long an elite unit, the Baltimore D/ST ranked just 19th last season in fantasy points, its worst finish in the past 10 years. The Ravens managed only four top-10 fantasy weeks, which was more than just six other teams. The offseason signing of safety Eric Weddle helps, but Baltimore did little else to improve a defense that finished last in the league in interceptions (six) and 28th in forced fumbles (eight). There is some talent here, but it's hard to expect high-end production from a unit led by the aging Weddle (31), Terrell Suggs (33), Elvis Dumervil (32) and Lardarius Webb (30).
Fri, Jul 22
	102.5
Buccaneers D/ST D/ST		FA			
@Atl
	Sun 1:00		
Given that they finished 6'10 last season, it was easy to miss the fact that the Bucs were outstanding against the run. They allowed just 3.4 ypc, second best in the NFL behind the Broncos. Tampa Bay also ranked among the top 10 in forced fumbles, tackles for loss, yardage allowed and blocks. Of course, the defense still allowed 26.1 ppg and finished 17th in fantasy points, so there is work to be done. Robert Ayers, Daryl Smith and Brent Grimes were solid offseason additions, but each is over 30, while rookies Vernon Hargreaves III and Noah Spence are potential future stars but not ready to elevate this unit in 2016.
Fri, Jul 22
	102.4
Vikings D/ST D/ST		HAN			
@Ten
	Sun 1:00		
The Vikings' defense took a big step forward last season, finishing seventh in the league in sacks (43) and allowing the fifth-fewest points (302). Minnesota's D/ST posted 10 top-10 fantasy weeks, which trailed only Kansas City. With little offseason roster turnover, the Vikings return a talented group that includes Everson Griffen, Linval Joseph, Anthony Barr, Harrison Smith and emerging Eric Kendricks. They're dealing with better offenses on the schedule this season, but the Vikings will be a solid spot-start option given the right matchup.
Fri, Jul 22
	95.5
Lions D/ST D/ST		FA			
@Ind
	Sun 4:25		
After finishing as a top-five D/ST in 2014, the Lions plummeted all the way to 20th last season. Although their pass rush remained strong (43 sacks, tied for seventh in the NFL), they gave up 400 points and picked off just nine passes (26th in the league). The D/ST cracked the top-10 fantasy rankings only three times, which was worse than all but two teams. There isn't much reason to expect better production this season. There is some talent with Ezekiel Ansah, DeAndre Levy and Darius Slay, but this group is a long way from its 2014 level.
Fri, Jul 22
	93.4
Colts D/ST D/ST		FA			
Det
	Sun 4:25		
The Colts have provided decent D/ST production over the past three seasons, but they just can't seem to do enough to move into the league's upper echelon. Last season Indianapolis intercepted 17 passes (tied for sixth in the NFL) and scored five TDs (seventh) but finished in the lower third of the league in points and yardage allowed. CB Patrick Robinson was a much-needed addition opposite Vontae Davis, but the loss of standout ILB Jerrell Freeman will hurt. Davis, D'Qwell Jackson, Henry Anderson and Kendall Langford will lead what figures to be a middle-of-the-pack D/ST unit.
Fri, Jul 22
	93.3
Jaguars D/ST D/ST		FA			
GB
	Sun 1:00		
The Jaguars received a massive influx of talent on D in the offseason by signing Prince Amukamara, Tashaun Gipson and Malik Jackson and drafting Jalen Ramsey and Myles Jack. Plus, the Jaguars will have the services of Dante Fowler, who missed his rookie year with a torn ACL after the Jaguars took him with the third pick in the 2015 draft. But the Jaguars are young and still have glaring holes, and Ramsey's knee must be healthy. Plus, they face a tough slate early, with games against the Chargers, Ravens and Colts. Given those concerns, they aren't worth drafting, even though they are headed in the right direction.
Fri, Jul 22
	93.2
Bears D/ST D/ST		FA			
@Hou
	Sun 1:00		
The Bears struggled again on defense last season, which led to a 27th-place finish in fantasy points, their third straight season near the bottom of the league. They ranked 30th in the NFL in interceptions (eight), forced fumbles (six), tackles for loss (64) and passes defensed (53). The good news is that Chicago made some impactful moves in the offseason, adding veterans Akiem Hicks, Jerrell Freeman and Danny Trevathan and drafting Leonard Floyd, Jonathan Bullard and Deon Bush. All should play significant roles for a unit that is on the rise but not yet ready to make a major leap forward.
Fri, Jul 22
	92.6
Patriots D/ST D/ST		akc			
@Ari
	Sun 8:30		
While the Patriots are best known for the points they pile up on offense, their D/ST has ranked among the top 10 fantasy units in five of the past six seasons. Last season the Patriots tied for the league lead in forced fumbles (22) and finished second in sacks (49). Although they traded their top pass rusher, Chandler Jones (12' sacks), to Arizona, additions Terrance Knighton, Chris Long and Shea McClellin should ensure there is not much of a dip in performance. The Pats face a relatively weak slate of opposing offenses in 2016, although there's a tough test in Week 1 against the Cardinals.
Fri, Jul 22
	90.1
Eagles D/ST D/ST		FA			
Cle
	Sun 1:00		
Chip Kelly is best known for his offensive innovations, but his style also affected Philly's D during his tenure there. The Eagles' fast pace left the D on the field for tons of extra snaps, and it showed in the stats: The Eagles ranked among the bottom five teams in yards allowed in each of Kelly's three seasons. But they also led the league with 18 non-offensive TDs over the past two seasons, and with Kelly gone, they'll get more rest. That won't solve every problem, though. The team is switching to a 4-3 scheme, and holes remain at LB and CB. The Eagles do play Cleveland in Week 1, so they are a draft-and-drop candidate.
Fri, Jul 22
	88.8
Steelers D/ST D/ST		HB			
@Wsh
	Mon 7:10		
Big plays made a big difference for the Steelers last season, as they finished tied for sixth in INTs (17), fourth in fumble recoveries (13) and third in sacks (48). That success helped them rank eighth in fantasy points, but it also obscured the fact that they finished 21st in yards allowed. LB is a concern heading into 2016: James Harrison is 38, and Ryan Shazier, Bud Dupree and Lawrence Timmons are coming off rough seasons. The secondary is solid, and DEs Cameron Heyward and Stephon Tuitt have the gaps covered, but it will be tough for this unit to sustain last year's turnover numbers, likely meaning a slight step back.
Fri, Jul 22
	87.9
Giants D/ST D/ST		FA			
@Dal
	Sun 4:25		
The Giants were abysmal on defense last season. They ranked last in yards allowed (6,725) and 30th in points allowed (442). No one was more aware of those problems than their own front office, so they spent the offseason overhauling the personnel. The Giants spent big in free agency on DE Olivier Vernon, CB Janoris Jenkins and DT Damon Harrison and used high draft picks on CB Eli Apple and FS Darian Thompson. With Jason Pierre-Paul closer to full health, this unit will be better in 2016, but voids remain at linebacker and safety. There is still work to be done before the Giants are fantasy-relevant.
Fri, Jul 22
	87.1
Saints D/ST D/ST		FA			
Oak
	Sun 1:00		
The Saints' D/ST has ranked 28th or worse during four of the past five seasons. That includes 31st-place finishes in both fantasy points and yardage allowed in each of the past two seasons. The Saints allowed a league-high 476 points last year, intercepted only nine passes (26th) and recorded 31 sacks (25th). The additions of Nick Fairley, James Laurinaitis and first-round pick Sheldon Rankins will help in the short term, but this is a unit with major problems behind young stars Cameron Jordan, Delvin Breaux and Kenny Vaccaro. Even if the personnel is somewhat better, the Saints' D/ST still projects as fantasy's worst.
Fri, Jul 22
	85.9
Falcons D/ST D/ST		JSBS			
TB
	Sun 1:00		
It's hard to find a team that does a worse job of penetrating the backfield than the Falcons. They ranked dead last in sacks last season (19) and second to last in tackles for loss (64). Atlanta has attempted to address those issues in the draft in recent years and hopes that those early picks-- Vic Beasley, Ra'Shede Hageman and Deion Jones--will help make a difference. The secondary is strong with Desmond Trufant, Robert Alford and 2016 first-round pick Keanu Neal, but this isn't a unit you want to bank on going into the season.
Fri, Jul 22
	85.3
Redskins D/ST D/ST		FA			
Pit
	Mon 7:10		
The Redskins' D/ST cracked the top 20 in fantasy points for the first time since 2007 last season, ranking 14th in the league. But that success was the result of a lot of luck--the unit forced 22 fumbles and recovered 15 of them, numbers that aren't sustainable. Meanwhile, the Skins surrendered 6,090 yards (fifth most in the league), which is a sign of serious issues. They did overhaul their secondary with the additions of Josh Norman, Su'a Cravens and Kendall Fuller and are solid up front, but linebacker is a problem and so is a tough schedule. In other words, there is no reason to draft them.

Chargers D/ST D/ST		FA			
@KC
	Sun 1:00		
The Chargers ranked 15th in the league with nine fumble recoveries last season. And that completes the list of fantasy-relevant categories in which they finished in the top half of the league. Overall, they were the fourth-worst D/ST in fantasy, managing just one TD, 11 interceptions and 32 sacks. First-round pick Joey Bosa is a much-needed addition to the team's pass rush, but San Diego didn't improve much otherwise and lost safety Eric Weddle to Baltimore. If there's one saving grace, San Diego faces a fairly soft slate of opposing offenses, so this is a unit for streamers to monitor.

Titans D/ST D/ST		FA			
Min
	Sun 1:00		
The Titans' D/ST struggled again last season, finishing 23rd in fantasy points, the seventh straight season in which they ranked worse than 15th. The unit allowed 423 points (sixth most in the NFL), intercepted just 11 passes (21st) and forced only 11 fumbles (23rd). There is experienced talent at every level of the defense--Jurrell Casey up front, Wesley Woodyard and Brian Orakpo at linebacker, Jason McCourty and Da'Norris Searcy in the secondary--and rookie D-linemen Kevin Dodd and Austin Johnson will help. But enough voids remain to minimize the Titans' improvement this season.

Dolphins D/ST D/ST		FA			
@Sea
	Sun 4:05		
In most formats, there is no sense in drafting a D/ST you don't want in your lineup in Week 1. Considering that the Dolphins open 2016 with trips to Seattle and New England, you can comfortably skip over them on draft day, then monitor for improvement as a potential midseason pickup. They brought in Mario Williams, Kiko Alonso, Byron Maxwell and Isa Abdul-Quddus, but those additions are more than offset by the losses of Olivier Vernon, Derrick Shelby and Brent Grimes. Ndamukong Suh and IDP stud Reshad Jones offer a glimmer of hope but not enough of one to make the Dolphins draftable.

49ers D/ST D/ST		FA			
LA
	Mon 10:20		
Talk about a collapse: The 49ers went from a top-10 unit for four straight seasons to dead last in 2015. The Niners ranked 29th in yardage allowed, and that issue doesn't figure to get any better with Chip Kelly in town. (The Eagles ranked 28th or worse during each of Kelly's three seasons with the team.) NaVorro Bowman, Ian Williams, Aaron Lynch and recent first-round picks Arik Armstead and DeForest Buckner provide some reasons for optimism, but San Francisco will also be dealing with one of the league's toughest schedules, which includes trips to Carolina and Seattle during the first three weeks of the season.

Cowboys D/ST D/ST		YU			
NYG
	Sun 4:25		
Tony Romo's injury woes were devastating to Dallas' 2015 prospects, but the defense didn't do the team any favors. Fantasy's No. 25 scoring unit ranked 30th in INTs (eight), forced fumbles (six) and fumble recoveries (three). The Cowboys added Cedric Thornton to help replace Greg Hardy but did little else to improve their defense during the offseason. The return of Orlando Scandrick from a torn ACL and MCL will help, but four-week suspensions to Randy Gregory and DeMarcus Lawrence will be devastating for the team's pass rush and place an even greater burden on Sean Lee, Rolando McClain and Byron Jones.

Browns D/ST D/ST		FA			
@Phi
	Sun 1:00		
Cleveland's defense hasn't been good for quite some time, but its D/ST hit a 10-year low by finishing 30th last season. The Browns struggled to get to the quarterback, managing only 29 sacks (fifth fewest in the league), and also recorded only 74 tackles for loss (sixth fewest). Tashaun Gipson and Karlos Dansby are out, and Emmanuel Ogbah, Rahim Moore and Demario Davis are in. That doesn't exactly scream improvement. Cornerback Joe Haden is coming off a rough, injury-plagued season, and this defense has very little firepower otherwise. Needless to say, you should be staying far, far away.

Stephen Gostkowski, NE K		AN			
@Ari
	Sun 8:30		
Kickers are rarely worth any investment in fantasy, but Gostkowski makes a strong case. The 32-year-old has been fantasy's top-scoring kicker in each of the past three seasons and no worse than third in the past five. Last season he posted 10 top-10 fantasy weeks, marking the fourth straight season he led the league in that category. Gostkowski has converted at least 92 percent of his field goal attempts the past three seasons, including 10 of 12 from 50-plus yards. In the Patriots' high-scoring offense, he is easily your top option and the only kicker worth drafting prior to the final round.
Fri, Jul 15

Adam Vinatieri, Ind K		FA			
Det
	Sun 4:25		
Vinatieri was one of the least consistent kickers last season: He ranked only 15th in fantasy points but managed seven top-10 weeks (tied for seventh in the league). That varying production was a result of the Colts' offensive woes, which limited him to 27 field goal attempts. Still, he made 92.6 percent of those tries (fourth best). With Andrew Luck under center in 2013 and 2014, Vinatieri ranked among the top five kickers, so a healthy Luck this season means the 43-year-old Vinatieri shouldn't have trouble racking up fantasy points in one of the league's highest-scoring offenses.

Steven Hauschka, Sea K [Breaking News] 		LEE			
Mia
	Sun 4:05		
Hauschka posted eight top-10 weeks (tied for second most in the league) en route to finishing fifth among kickers in fantasy points last season. He has now ranked among the top 10 fantasy kickers in each of the past three years. Hauschka has converted 90 percent of his tries over the past four seasons (sixth in the league), including 73 of 74 kicks of less than 40 yards. He missed four of his 44 extra-point attempts last season, but his overall accuracy suggests that shouldn't be a concern in the future. He should be one of the first kickers off the board in the final round.
Fri, Jul 15
	140.3
Josh Brown, NYG K		BUNA			
@Dal
	Sun 4:25		
The Giants made a lot of big moves during the offsea.son, but one of the most important ones went largely unnoticed. They re-signed Brown, whose 93.1 percent field goal conversion rate trailed only that of Stephen Gostkowski and Adam Vinatieri over the past two seasons. During that span, Brown nailed all seven of his tries from at least 50 yards. He was the only kicker who was perfect from that distance (minimum five attempts), and his eight top-10 weeks in 2015 was tied for second. He is one of the league's best kickers and works in a quality offense, meaning you should look to steal him in the final round of your draft.
Fri, Jul 15
	136
Dan Bailey, Dal K		FA			
NYG
	Sun 4:25		
Bailey nailed 30 of 32 attempts and converted each of his 25 extra points last season, a testament to his outstanding accuracy. Since entering the NFL in 2011, Bailey has converted a league-leading 90.6 percent of his field goals. Despite Dallas' horrific offensive production last season, Bailey still finished 11th among kickers in fantasy points, his first season outside the top 10. With Tony Romo and Dez Bryant back to full health and Ezekiel Elliott running the ball, the Cowboys' offense is sure to rebound, and you should scoop up Bailey early in the final round.

Roberto Aguayo, TB K		FA

	Sun 1:00			135.4
Mason Crosby, GB K		MC			
@Jax
	Sun 1:00		
No one has attempted more field goals than Crosby over the past nine years, and after a couple of shaky seasons, Crosby has rebounded with three straight quality campaigns. He has nailed 85.7 percent of his FGs since 2013, including 52 of 53 from inside 40 yards. Crosby and Stephen Gostkowski were the only kickers to attempt at least 30 PATs and convert all of them last season. Green Bay's offensive struggles limited Crosby to 16th place among kickers in 2015, but he cracked the top eight in the prior two seasons when the offense was humming. He is a strong bounce-back candidate.
Fri, Jul 15
	132.3
Justin Tucker, Bal K		FA			
Buf
	Sun 1:00		
Tucker has been one of fantasy's most consistent producers since he entered the NFL, finishing each of his four seasons among the top 11 kickers in fantasy points. He ranked ninth in 2015, a season in which the Ravens' offense was annihilated by injuries. Still, Tucker managed eight top-10 fantasy weeks (tied for second). He attempted a league-high 10 field goals from 50-plus yards but converted only four. Despite trailing only Blair Walsh and Greg Zuerlein in 50-plus-yard attempts since entering the league, Tucker has converted 87.8 percent of all FGs, which ranks 13th. He is as reliable as they come at the position.

Chris Boswell, Pit K		SHEA			
@Wsh
	Mon 7:10			131.9
Graham Gano, Car K		JSBS			
@Den
	Thu 8:30		
Gano was fantasy's No. 2 kicker in 2015 thanks primarily to Carolina's offensive success. He posted seven top-10 fantasy weeks, which tied him for seventh among kickers. Gano led the league with 59 PAT attempts and 56 conversions and was tied for fifth in field goal attempts. His 84.7 percent field goal conversion rate since 2013, however, is slightly below league average. In fact, the journeyman finished no better than 14th among kickers in 2013 and 2014. The Panthers' offense is a good bet to regress this season, which will leave Gano as more of a fringe fantasy starter than a top-end option.

Matt Prater, Det K		FA			
@Ind
	Sun 4:25		
Prater had an impressive 2015 campaign, though he attempted only 24 FGs. He nailed 91.7 percent of those tries--tied for fifth in the NFL--despite an aver.age distance of 41.0 yards, second highest among kickers with at least 20 attempts. Prater ranked only 19th among kickers in fantasy points, but he posted four top-six finishes after Week 10 and has been more successful in the past, finishing second in fantasy points in 2013 and ninth in 2012. Over the past three seasons, Prater has made 77.8 percent of his kicks from 50-plus yards, fifth best in the league (minimum 12 attempts). He won't be short on opportunities in 2016.

Chandler Catanzaro, Ari K		MAN			
NE
	Sun 8:30			122.8
Matt Bryant, Atl K		CHUN			
TB
	Sun 1:00		
A quad injury cost Bryant six games and led to a disappointing 2015 season. He struggled even when healthy, converting just 14 of 18 field goals while managing only two top-10 fantasy weeks. Despite Bryant's rough year, don't write him off. Over the past six seasons, his 88.6 percent FG conver.sion rate ranks fifth. He was a top-12 fantasy kicker in four out of five seasons prior to 2015, including a trio of top-five campaigns. Bryant's age (41) and the Falcons' offensive dysfunction are mild concerns, but he is a quality kicker with the added benefit of kicking primarily in a dome. Consider him a fringe starter.
